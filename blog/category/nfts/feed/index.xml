<h2>NFT Morning Show: 8Aliens, The Merge, and Market Trends</h2>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/piovincenzo_">Pio.eth</a> hosted the NFT Morning Radio on Aug. 15, 2022, with a runtime of 1:33:39 and 6.3K people tuning in.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/PA2sIeHwUT">https://t.co/PA2sIeHwUT</a></p>&mdash; Pio.eth (@piovincenzo_) <a href="https://twitter.com/piovincenzo_/status/1559525419090690048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Here is a summary of that Twitter Spaces.</p>



<h2>Are you buying 8Aliens?</h2>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/allnick">NFTNick.eth</a></strong> notes that he exited his positions. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> asks if he&#8217;s looking at buying anything on the NFT side. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> says no. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> talks about <strong>8Aliens</strong>, and jokes whether it can take over Bored Apes <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f606.png" alt="ðŸ˜†" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1024x614.png" alt="8Aliens are collectible, interactive NFTs you can chat with." class="wp-image-199" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1024x614.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-300x180.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-768x461.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1536x922.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-2048x1229.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1200x720.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1980x1188.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Each Alien and its associated interactions are generated by algorithms and our Artificial Intelligence.</figcaption></figure>



<ul><li><strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> says he&#8217;s looking for a discount on the top end of the NFT market. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> mentions that 8aliens was a project that caused Nick to raise his eyebrow on the YouTube show. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> deflects critiques that it was outrageous for his show to suggest that 8aliens (an NFT project with 10,000 supply) would go down in price.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>8Aliens has been created by Heptalabs a team of 7 artists and engineers working on turning NFTs into interactive experiences</p><cite>8Aliens OpenSea Description</cite></blockquote></figure>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/SpeculatorArt">Kix.eth</a></strong> says he trashed allow-lists during the bull market, but he likes how 8aliens ensured a good portion of the NFTs were going to people that were bullish or invested in the project. A lot of the free mints get bought by multi wallets and sell at whatever price they want. <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/jesseshalfon">Jesse Halfon</a></strong> talks about how the people that made money were in their discord. </li><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> notes that the most bullish thing for an NFT project is taking legit venture capital money. He mentions how the first bull run in the NFT space would be a fine art bull run and full adoption by the traditional art world.</li></ul>



<h2>NFT Market Trends Report</h2>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/_thesignal">Signal (she/her)</a></strong> notes that overnight trading volume is 14.6 million, down from 25 million. She is seeing a pullback across the market, with BAYC at 79, MAYC at 13.7, and CryptoPunks at 69. <strong>Signal </strong>says the overall crypto is doing well, but the OpenSea volume is down in the mid teens.</li><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> mentions that <a href="https://axie.substack.com/">Axie Infinity</a> has removed token rewards from its classic game mode to attract users to a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/axie-infinity-cuts-rewards-from-classic-game-subtly-forcing-p2e-players-to-new-mode">new game mode</a>. </li><li><strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> notes that authorities arrested a developer who wrote code for Tornado Cash.</li></ul>



<h2>How will the Merge impact NFTs?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Kix.eth</strong> considers a theory suggesting that ETH tops out at $2,200 USD per ETH. <strong>Kix.eth</strong> says the market may be seeing money out in the blue chip NFT projects based on his gut feeling.</li><li><strong>Node</strong> says he put in a couple of offers on different Clone X NFTs.</li><li><strong>Jesse Halfon</strong> offers technical non-analysis, saying ETH is going back to $1200 USD for a couple of months.<strong> </strong>But 2022 is the year of ETH â€“&nbsp;The Merge is coming. ETH is under-appreciated relative to the technicals, 2021 was the &#8220;Year of NFTs,&#8221; and &#8220;Bitcoin is for Boomers.&#8221; Narrative matters. </li><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> says there&#8217;s a case to be made for sure, and there&#8217;s a lot of uncertainty around The Merge and its impact on price. </li><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/xBenJamminx">BenJammin.eth</a></strong> notes that theyâ€™re seeing an NFT bleed after people get excited for prices rising. With the Merge scheduled a month from now, people want to stack ETH because they believe the price will climb due to the Merge. We&#8217;ll likely see more NFT bleeding until then.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-left"><blockquote><p>focus on artists or creators that are trying to grow, rather than aping into NFT degen mints that are likely going to zero.</p><cite><strong>BenJammin.eth</strong></cite></blockquote></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> says itâ€™s hard to identify which artists are favored by the market, but if you strike gold with that, youâ€™ll get rewarded. </li><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/sgsand1">Spencer Gordon-Sand</a></strong> (&#8220;Spencer&#8221;) notes that theyâ€™ve been thinking about what happens post-Merge, and he feels giga-bearish on the NFT markets after the Merge. <strong>Spencer</strong> is surprised how well NFT markets have held up, and believes the markets have not seen true capitulation yet. He&#8217;s looking to enter positions on dumps and pick up large positions in a lot of blue chip NFTs.</li><li><strong>Kix.eth</strong> jokes that he&#8217;s going to create a narrative around the proof of work NFTs. Then he&#8217;s going to accumulate a bunch of CryptoPunks, Art Blocks, Bored Apes, and make millions.</li></ul>



<h2>Which NFTs are worth buying? Which NFTs are scams?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> talks about how there&#8217;s interest in Clone X succeeding because it was acquired for a lot of money by Nike. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> says he&#8217;s not bullish on [most?] NFT projects because they&#8217;ve taken money and not doing anything. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> notes that he could make a case that Moonbirds is a web3 business so long as Kevin Rose stays interested.</li><li><strong><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/depechenode_">Node</a></strong>&#8216;s Twitter Poll shows that 60% of people who voted said that it was the most likely &#8220;Top Tier&#8221; project to fade into obscurity.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="600" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-9.png" alt="Azuki starts with a collection of 10,000 avatars that give you membership access to The Garden: a corner of the internet where artists, builders, and web3 enthusiasts meet to create a decentralized future." class="wp-image-220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-9.png 600w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-9-300x300.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-9-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption>The Azuki NFT project is considered a top tier collection, but some question its long-term viability.</figcaption></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> says they&#8217;ve seen loyal communities to projects that were scams. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> mentions that 90% of communities have been loyal to scams. <strong>Node</strong> talks about how there&#8217;s loyalty for projects that never crack one ETH. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> inquires if Azuki raised venture money. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> notes that there&#8217;s plenty of people that took money out, and there&#8217;s stories of misuse of capital. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> talks about how there&#8217;s a bunch of people who took advantage of the market and operated without integrity.</li></ul>



<h2>What signal do VCs convey when they invest in an NFT collection?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Node</strong> says the market is where it was in 2021. <strong>Spencer</strong> says he has mixed feelings on whether VC investment mean it&#8217;s a rug or not.<strong> </strong>He&#8217;s seen VC funded projects that tend to sell more new collections.Their incentive is to hit revenue and get acquired.</li><li><strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> talks about how VCs have been dumping on retail consumers via tokens, so integrity is a spectrum. <strong>Kix.eth</strong> says they agree with <strong>Pio.eth</strong>: if VCs invest in an NFT company, it means you can take the rug risk off the table because they&#8217;re betting on their own. <strong>Kix.eth</strong> mentions that Nike is making sure this is a legit operating team.</li><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> notes that they are sick of NFT projects taking 80% of the primary sale funds and not hiring people. <strong>BenJammin.eth</strong> mentions that itâ€™s a level of patience since hiring 40 to 50 people would take a while.</li></ul>

<h2>NFT Daily Summary, The Merge, and Chimpers NFT</h2>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/farokh/status/1558098734981988355">@Farokh</a> hosted RUG RADIO <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f399.png" alt="ðŸŽ™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />: GM NFTs <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2600.png" alt="â˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> on Aug. 12, 2022, with a runtime of 1:34:22 and 2.9K people tuning in.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Here is a summary of that Twitter Spaces.</p>



<h2>Intro &amp; NFT Daily Summary</h2>



<ul><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;wonders where his co-hosts are, roasting <strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong> for a few minutes because he was late <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f602.png" alt="ðŸ˜‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </li><li>The <a href="https://linktr.ee/rugradio">Rug Radio</a> show starts with a macro and NFT daily summary.  <strong>@Farokh</strong> notes that Ethereum is looking strong and the NFT market is heating up; it&#8217;s fun.&nbsp;He adds that Chimpers NFT team will join them on stage. </li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;jokes that he canceled Pio.eth&#8217;s show earlier that morning.&nbsp;<strong>Pio.eth (@piovincenzo_)</strong>&nbsp;said the Twitter Spaces audio wasnâ€™t working and had to move the show to Discord audio, but it was not good â€“&nbsp;with about 50% audience drop-off.</li><li><strong>OSF (@osf_nft)</strong>&nbsp;gives the daily market report. He mentions that:<ul><li>there was a sell off in tech stocks</li></ul><ul><li>Bitcoin was flirting with 25k yesterday, and ETH is out performing everything.</li><li>the ETH Merge is being planned for the 15th or 16 September.</li><li>mentions that the proof of work involves a series of algorithms that validate transactions on their own rig, and miners get paid for performing those calculations</li><li>some miners may create a copy of the current network and continue running it as a proof of work methodology, which will duplicate all of the existing ERC tokens, NFTs, etc</li></ul></li></ul>



<h2>What does the ETH Merge mean for your NFTs?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;notes that people have been buying Ethereum classic since the Merge became more on the horizon.</li><li><strong><strong>OSF (@osf_nft)</strong></strong>&nbsp;if miners fork Ethereum now, it will have all the transactions as of the fork&#8217;s date. He adds: <ul><li>Beware of replay attack, where you can replicate a transaction on proof of work from proof of work to proof of stake.&nbsp;</li><li>There&#8217;s a risk you end up selling your Ape on the <em>real</em> ETH proof of stake network at five Eth if you did that transaction on the forked proof of work chain.</li><li>Potential solution: transfer your NFTs on proof of work to a new wallet, and then sell it to minimize the risk of a replay attack.</li><li>Forked POW NFTs should be worth zero, but there may be a market for them. People love meme stuff.</li></ul></li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="772" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png" alt="Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake, accord. 3iQ Research Group.

<ul><li><strong>Simon (@Simon_Goldberg)</strong>&nbsp;notes that marketplaces (like OpenSea) have to support proof of work to buy or sell NFTs.</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;notes that there&#8217;s always going to be proof work miners on the chain.</li><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;notes that old chains might have some value.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>KÎžNOBI (@KenobiDesigns)</strong> inquires if they will have to change terms of service to assign the right IP rights to things.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Simon (@Simon_Goldberg)</strong>&nbsp;mentions that the contract owner will still have access to that contract on proof of work. Project creators have access to the metadata, and if they change one contract, they&#8217;d be able to remove all the data for that chain.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;says they need a long form conversation about the Merge.</li></ul>



<h2>NFT Market Trends</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;mentions that the last three days have been 20 to 25 million volume, which sounds low but is up 60% from the lows of the last month.

<ul><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;says the vast majority of stuff is down over the last seven days, and every single mid tier projects is down 5 to 10%.&nbsp;Bored Apes are flat and CryptoPunks are relatively flat, but the top tier stuff is still holding. Some mid-tier projects are up: Penguins are up 50%. CryptoDickButts are up 60%. </li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;notes that there&#8217;s been a lot of fun stuff you could get in on, and new projects are cracking up.&nbsp;<strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;notes that they&#8217;ve had multiple sweeps over the last couple of weeks, and they don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re going back into USDC because of the pump or just holding on to the ETH.</li><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;says if volume returns to a seasoned project, itâ€™s getting sold into.&nbsp;He notes that thereâ€™s only very few projects out there, and when they see a pump, a lot of people will use this opportunity to sell. Mando says that the overall markets in OpenSea volumes are at 200 million in volume, which would show a bottoming of the NFT market.&nbsp;If OS does the same volume as July, that would be a good sign.</li></ul>



<h2>Building NFT Brands in the Bear Market</h2>



<ul><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;talks about how every pump brings on more listings, and every time your project goes up in value, thereâ€™s going to be a lot of people that are going to rush the list.&nbsp;He mentions that itâ€™s going to be more work on the founder side this time around.&nbsp;Farokh&nbsp;notes that being a genuine founder in NFT isnâ€™t easy at the moment, spending 100 plus hours a week trying to create value for holders, and any impact of work gets immediately sold.</li><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;notes that often the projects which are showing value are the ones which continue to deliver.&nbsp;He&nbsp;mentions that it makes sense that people want to secure their finances more during this period.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;mentions that the market is so small, it&#8217;s complicated to the average person, and they need to go to the toilet three times.&nbsp;Farokh&nbsp;notes that if the month of August is just a month of uncertainty, it&#8217;s just a month of people really need liquidity.</li><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;notes that they&#8217;ve been given more opportunities to invest in startups in the space.&nbsp;It&#8217;s difficult to assess value and business plans.&nbsp;Mando says they often don&#8217;t know if a project isn&#8217;t doing well, and if they have the right founders, they can reenergize.&nbsp;The concept of 99% of projects going to zero means that 99% of founders are going to fail. Failure is going to have to be accepted. They would love to see a project which doesnâ€™t feel like itâ€™s hitting the right tone when it comes to the utility. Theyâ€™d rather the whole community migrate to a new utility.</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;notes that a lot of people forget that building the community is one part and nurturing that community is the second part.&nbsp;It&#8217;s about being around and showing up.</li><li><strong>OSF (@osf_nft)</strong>&nbsp;says a lot of it comes down to how much money you took in upfront and what you stated you would do with that money. There are other ways you can drive value back to that project. <strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;says that someone in their Discord built a model evaluation showing Rug Radio was valued at $60 million.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>OSF (@osf_nft)</strong>&nbsp;talks about how it took them a year to bring their project back to a level they were at.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;notes that if you raise money last year and you&#8217;re giving up now, then you never had it.</li><li><strong>Ser Joey (@PunkHot10)</strong>&nbsp;says they understand that the duty to carry on and try is to increase revenue and profit, but people fail a lot within that.</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;notes how Ser Joey used to run a weekly chart where trending punks were voted on.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>Welcome to <a href="http://alphaback.xyz/">AlphaBack&#8217;s</a> Twitter Spaces Summaries (#TSS). In this series, we summarize Twitter Spaces that you don&#8217;t want to miss. Why? Because we all love Twitter Spaces, but dammit if they aren&#8217;t difficult to tune into at times â€“ whether it&#8217;s the inconvenient timing or unedited / off-topic meandering. In this first post of the series, the Koala Bot Club talks about its game automation platform and its integration with the #SolSuite platform.</p>



<p><em>n.b. Summaries are edited for brevity and inconsistencies may occur due to crosstalk or audio quality. The content presented is not financial advice. Do your own research and review <a href="#disclaimerandrisks">the disclaimer below</a>.</em></p>
