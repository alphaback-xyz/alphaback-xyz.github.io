<h2>NFT Morning Show: 8Aliens, The Merge, and Market Trends</h2>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/piovincenzo_">Pio.eth</a> hosted the NFT Morning Radio on Aug. 15, 2022, with a runtime of 1:33:39 and 6.3K people tuning in.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/PA2sIeHwUT">https://t.co/PA2sIeHwUT</a></p>&mdash; Pio.eth (@piovincenzo_) <a href="https://twitter.com/piovincenzo_/status/1559525419090690048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Here is a summary of that Twitter Spaces.</p>



<h2>Are you buying 8Aliens?</h2>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/allnick">NFTNick.eth</a></strong> notes that he exited his positions. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> asks if he&#8217;s looking at buying anything on the NFT side. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> says no. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> talks about <strong>8Aliens</strong>, and jokes whether it can take over Bored Apes <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f606.png" alt="ðŸ˜†" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1024x614.png" alt="8Aliens are collectible, interactive NFTs you can chat with." class="wp-image-199" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1024x614.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-300x180.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-768x461.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1536x922.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-2048x1229.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1200x720.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1980x1188.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Each Alien and its associated interactions are generated by algorithms and our Artificial Intelligence.</figcaption></figure>



<ul><li><strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> says he&#8217;s looking for a discount on the top end of the NFT market. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> mentions that 8aliens was a project that caused Nick to raise his eyebrow on the YouTube show. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> deflects critiques that it was outrageous for his show to suggest that 8aliens (an NFT project with 10,000 supply) would go down in price.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>8Aliens has been created by Heptalabs a team of 7 artists and engineers working on turning NFTs into interactive experiences</p><cite>8Aliens OpenSea Description</cite></blockquote></figure>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/SpeculatorArt">Kix.eth</a></strong> says he trashed allow-lists during the bull market, but he likes how 8aliens ensured a good portion of the NFTs were going to people that were bullish or invested in the project. A lot of the free mints get bought by multi wallets and sell at whatever price they want. <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/jesseshalfon">Jesse Halfon</a></strong> talks about how the people that made money were in their discord. </li><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> notes that the most bullish thing for an NFT project is taking legit venture capital money. He mentions how the first bull run in the NFT space would be a fine art bull run and full adoption by the traditional art world.</li></ul>



<h2>NFT Market Trends Report</h2>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/_thesignal">Signal (she/her)</a></strong> notes that overnight trading volume is 14.6 million, down from 25 million. She is seeing a pullback across the market, with BAYC at 79, MAYC at 13.7, and CryptoPunks at 69. <strong>Signal </strong>says the overall crypto is doing well, but the OpenSea volume is down in the mid teens.</li><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> mentions that <a href="https://axie.substack.com/">Axie Infinity</a> has removed token rewards from its classic game mode to attract users to a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/axie-infinity-cuts-rewards-from-classic-game-subtly-forcing-p2e-players-to-new-mode">new game mode</a>. </li><li><strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> notes that authorities arrested a developer who wrote code for Tornado Cash.</li></ul>



<h2>How will the Merge impact NFTs?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Kix.eth</strong> considers a theory suggesting that ETH tops out at $2,200 USD per ETH. <strong>Kix.eth</strong> says the market may be seeing money out in the blue chip NFT projects based on his gut feeling.</li><li><strong>Node</strong> says he put in a couple of offers on different Clone X NFTs.</li><li><strong>Jesse Halfon</strong> offers technical non-analysis, saying ETH is going back to $1200 USD for a couple of months.<strong> </strong>But 2022 is the year of ETH â€“&nbsp;The Merge is coming. ETH is under-appreciated relative to the technicals, 2021 was the &#8220;Year of NFTs,&#8221; and &#8220;Bitcoin is for Boomers.&#8221; Narrative matters. </li><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> says there&#8217;s a case to be made for sure, and there&#8217;s a lot of uncertainty around The Merge and its impact on price. </li><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/xBenJamminx">BenJammin.eth</a></strong> notes that theyâ€™re seeing an NFT bleed after people get excited for prices rising. With the Merge scheduled a month from now, people want to stack ETH because they believe the price will climb due to the Merge. We&#8217;ll likely see more NFT bleeding until then.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-left"><blockquote><p>focus on artists or creators that are trying to grow, rather than aping into NFT degen mints that are likely going to zero.</p><cite><strong>BenJammin.eth</strong></cite></blockquote></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> says itâ€™s hard to identify which artists are favored by the market, but if you strike gold with that, youâ€™ll get rewarded. </li><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/sgsand1">Spencer Gordon-Sand</a></strong> (&#8220;Spencer&#8221;) notes that theyâ€™ve been thinking about what happens post-Merge, and he feels giga-bearish on the NFT markets after the Merge. <strong>Spencer</strong> is surprised how well NFT markets have held up, and believes the markets have not seen true capitulation yet. He&#8217;s looking to enter positions on dumps and pick up large positions in a lot of blue chip NFTs.</li><li><strong>Kix.eth</strong> jokes that he&#8217;s going to create a narrative around the proof of work NFTs. Then he&#8217;s going to accumulate a bunch of CryptoPunks, Art Blocks, Bored Apes, and make millions.</li></ul>



<h2>Which NFTs are worth buying? Which NFTs are scams?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> talks about how there&#8217;s interest in Clone X succeeding because it was acquired for a lot of money by Nike. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> says he&#8217;s not bullish on [most?] NFT projects because they&#8217;ve taken money and not doing anything. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> notes that he could make a case that Moonbirds is a web3 business so long as Kevin Rose stays interested.</li><li><strong><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/depechenode_">Node</a></strong>&#8216;s Twitter Poll shows that 60% of people who voted said that it was the most likely &#8220;Top Tier&#8221; project to fade into obscurity.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="600" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-9.png" alt="Azuki starts with a collection of 10,000 avatars that give you membership access to The Garden: a corner of the internet where artists, builders, and web3 enthusiasts meet to create a decentralized future." class="wp-image-220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-9.png 600w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-9-300x300.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-9-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption>The Azuki NFT project is considered a top tier collection, but some question its long-term viability.</figcaption></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> says they&#8217;ve seen loyal communities to projects that were scams. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> mentions that 90% of communities have been loyal to scams. <strong>Node</strong> talks about how there&#8217;s loyalty for projects that never crack one ETH. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> inquires if Azuki raised venture money. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> notes that there&#8217;s plenty of people that took money out, and there&#8217;s stories of misuse of capital. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> talks about how there&#8217;s a bunch of people who took advantage of the market and operated without integrity.</li></ul>



<h2>What signal do VCs convey when they invest in an NFT collection?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Node</strong> says the market is where it was in 2021. <strong>Spencer</strong> says he has mixed feelings on whether VC investment mean it&#8217;s a rug or not.<strong> </strong>He&#8217;s seen VC funded projects that tend to sell more new collections.Their incentive is to hit revenue and get acquired.</li><li><strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> talks about how VCs have been dumping on retail consumers via tokens, so integrity is a spectrum. <strong>Kix.eth</strong> says they agree with <strong>Pio.eth</strong>: if VCs invest in an NFT company, it means you can take the rug risk off the table because they&#8217;re betting on their own. <strong>Kix.eth</strong> mentions that Nike is making sure this is a legit operating team.</li><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> notes that they are sick of NFT projects taking 80% of the primary sale funds and not hiring people. <strong>BenJammin.eth</strong> mentions that itâ€™s a level of patience since hiring 40 to 50 people would take a while.</li></ul>
