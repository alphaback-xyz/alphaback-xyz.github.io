										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In this<em> </em>summary of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shocking NFT News &amp; Top Upcoming NFT Drop</span>, host The Parallax discuss Kingship NFT&#8217;s partnership with M&amp;M candies, Hello Kitty&#8217;s NFT, a16z investment in Ready Player Me, CloneX NFTs going on-chain, and more.</p>



<p><em>n.b. Summaries are edited for brevity and inconsistencies may occur due to crosstalk or audio quality. The content presented is not financial advice. Do your own research and review <a href="#disclaimerandrisks">the disclaimer below</a>.</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2>Parallax highlights NFT News &amp; Upcoming NFT Drops</h2>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/@EvilPlanIncCo">The Parallax</a> posted <em>Shocking NFT News &amp; Top Upcoming NFT Drop</em> on YouTube on Aug. 25, 2022:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6RIY8yuGjc
</div></figure>



<p>Parallax&nbsp;starts by discussing the <em>Hello Kitty and Friends</em> project, by Recur (who also worked on <em>Hey Arnold</em>, <em>Rugrats</em>, and <em>Carebears</em>). There’s concern that all of the projects are too similar and don’t offer anything beyond collectible art.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="468" height="246" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/hellokitty.png" alt="" class="wp-image-339" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/hellokitty.png 468w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/hellokitty-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></figure></div>


<p>But some people will find the Nickelodeon game valuable: you buy a collectible, you trade it in, get some slime, and then you combine your entities. On the other hand, looking at the Nickelodeon floor price, people aren’t valuing those NFTs as much as they did when they first came out.</p>



<p>Parallax&nbsp;takes a moment to promote the biweekly Parallax Academy courses, which focus on NFT marketing.&nbsp;There, he teaches about Ponzi schemes, bag holding culture, and how to create a project that doesn’t require bag holding. Instead, the focus will be on creating real value. Back to NFT news.</p>



<h2>a16z Makes NFT News by Injecting $56M into this project</h2>



<p>Parallax describes a new project called <em>Ready Player Me</em>, which just raised $56 million in the Series B from a16z. <em>Ready Player Me </em>is an avatar project, but there’s no NFT to buy. The project helps brands and companies create digital metaverse assets that can be used across worlds.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="468" height="245" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/readyplayerme.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-340" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/readyplayerme.jpg 468w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/readyplayerme-300x157.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></figure></div>


<p>The challenge is that every metaverse has its own technical challenges.&nbsp;<em>Ready Player Me</em> is creating a standard, such that one avatar (or digital asset) works across many different metaverse worlds.&nbsp; So imagine creating a selfie avatar that works across all metaverses.</p>



<h2>Generating 3D objects as NFTs</h2>



<p>Next, Parallax describes <em><a href="https://deepobjects.ai/">Deepobjects AI</a></em>, which is likely creating 3D assets as NFTs. There’s not much to go on from the website, but Parallax guesstimates that they will be generating 3D sneakers, statues, and more.&nbsp;Unclear if the founders (FTR Studio) are being mysterious on purpose.</p>



<h2>M&amp;M partners with Kingship, a BAYC-inspired musical group</h2>



<p>In other news, M&amp;M candy recently partnered with Kingship, a musical band formed from Bored Ape NFT characters.&nbsp;The BAYC owners themselves are not the people behind the band necessarily. The intent is to make the musicians behind the NFT characters interchangeable over time.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="305" height="382" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/kingshipmm-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-345" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/kingshipmm-1.png 305w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/kingshipmm-1-240x300.png 240w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /></figure></div>


<p>In that partnership, the group will sell M&amp;M candy boxes in 4,000 limited-edition set. The rarest version includes custom-printed candies with Kingship group members Captain, King, Arnell and Hud in individually numbered boxes from 1 to 100. Parallax notes that this is an interesting use case of IP and NFTs, where multiple holders come together to create value through collaboration with a brand that can generate revenue for the partnership. Parallax expects other NFT collections (such as Azuki, Doodles, etc.) to iterate on this pattern if it proves valuable. Similarly, we’re going to see more brands in all sectors get into the NFT space. Parallax expects candy companies, jewelry companies, and watch companies will enter the fray soon.</p>



<h2>CloneX goes on-chain</h2>



<p>Changing gears, Parallax&nbsp;notes that CloneX has started migrating some of their metadata from off-chain to on-chain.&nbsp;More products are moving on-chain, and it’ll be interesting to see what brands have a 100-year vision and make assets immutable.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="512" height="512" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-356" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image.png 512w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-300x300.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></figure></div>


<h2>Lean new tech &amp; imagine how it applies to NFTs</h2>



<p>Finally, Parallax&nbsp;notes that OpenAI, an artificial intelligence company, created a new feature that generates different clothing for characters, where the clothing moves in real time based on camera angles.&nbsp;NFT creators will have different ideas on how to use this technology.&nbsp;For instance, AI can generate a jacket asset that fits a particular NFT character model in a natural way, and yet it can fit another character with a different body type, too.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">AI fashion show using dall-e to generate hundreds of outfits of the day after tomorrow.

</div></figure>



<p>Remember to follow other macro technology trends, because they eventually find their way into the NFT space.</p>

As a result, future updates will be posted on <a href="./../../../category/retro/index.html">our blog</a> and sent out via a newsletter service (Mailchimp) rather than individual emails. So if you&#8217;ve been hesitantly opening my updates, here&#8217;s your chance to let them fade into the background <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f605.png" alt="😅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But if you love hearing from us, then make sure you <a href="http://eepurl.com/h4pPkz">opt-in to our email list here</a>!</p>



<h3>Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Fundraising</strong>. We received two more introductions to follower-funds and one more written commitment. All told, the end is near and we&#8217;re excited to conclude our fundraising.</li><li><strong>Exploring SSP Shortcut</strong>. We explored fulfilling ad inventory immediately by using supply side platforms (SSP). We successfully opened accounts with two SSPs – no small feat as we must meet their stringent publisher requirements.</li><li><strong>Monitoring Content Series</strong>. As you know, we published a content marketing experiment where we <a href="./../../../category/twitter-spaces-summaries/index.html">summarize popular Twitter Spaces</a>. The blog is now 37% of page views (&#8220;PV&#8221;) in the last 14 days, up 110% from the prior 14 day period. Overall traffic is up 93% in the same time period, from 188 PV to 364 PV. Our goal is to generate ~600 PV per Summary over a 12 week period to consider that experiment a scalable success.</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>Company Ops</strong>. We spent a few cycles polishing our surface areas, such as managing our signed agreements, setting up Carta for cap table management, and obtaining company insurance.</li></ul>



<h3>Challenges</h3>



<ul><li><strong>SSP Limitations</strong>. Despite opening accounts, various SSP limitations hinder our ability to take this shortcut. Instead, we&#8217;ll redouble efforts on the product leaderboard feature.</li></ul>



<h3>Asks</h3>

<h3>Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Fundraising</strong>. We closed two more investors, adding 20+ years of combined digital media and consumer-app experience to the team. Just $300K left in the round <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f605.png" alt="😅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li><li><strong>Debuted Content Series</strong>. We began experimenting with a content marketing strategy, wherein we <a href="./../../../category/twitter-spaces-summaries/index.html">summarize popular Twitter Spaces</a>. The goal is to generate SEO and shareable social media posts that are amplified by the Spaces&#8217; speakers.</li><li><strong>Overlay Prototype</strong>. Sandeep (Co-founder &amp; CTO) had a genius idea that will help us accelerate the advertising overlay prototype. We now have an internally released extension that can take over ads!

<p>We’re heads down building and fundraising for our NFT promotions ad network, so here’s another quick weekcap. But first a brief intro in case you’re new here:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>AlphaBack is a browser extension that pays users to look at NFTs (ads), with the goal of building a DAO-owned ad&nbsp;network.</em></p></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="652" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Alphaback_Extension_transparent_clean-1024x652.png" alt="AlphaBack pays users to look at NFT promotions" class="wp-image-39" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Alphaback_Extension_transparent_clean-1024x652.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Alphaback_Extension_transparent_clean-300x191.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Alphaback_Extension_transparent_clean-768x489.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Alphaback_Extension_transparent_clean-1200x764.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Alphaback_Extension_transparent_clean.png 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Also, we’re experimenting with a new section on these Retros called, <em>Food for Thought</em>. Review that (at the bottom of this note) if you want to go deeper.</p>



<h3>Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Fundraising</strong>. We closed three more angel investors on our SAFE!</li><li><strong>Allocations</strong>. We’re now up to <strong>$965,000</strong> in written commitments from investors. This is a <a href="./../../../payments-code-released-fundraising-continues/index.html">10% increase over last week</a>.</li><li><strong>Upgradeable Contracts</strong>. We‘re laying the foundation for faster iterations and future flexibility via upgradeable contracts. We estimate releasing that code within 2 weeks.</li></ul>



<h3>Challenges</h3>



<ul><li><strong>HackFS Hackathon</strong>. We had planned on participating in this hackathon, but prioritizing the release of the payments code meant that we didn’t have enough time for a meaningful submission.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>How You Can&nbsp;Help</strong></h3>

<h3>Food for Thought: NFT Promotions are hard.</h3>



<p>NFT projects continue to sprout. There are now approximately 80,300 NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain, up from 15,540 in 2021. And that doesn’t include the growing number of NFT projects on Solana. Importantly, marketing is a top expense for any NFT project.</p>



<p>A web3 marketing agency, Coinbound, says that “NFT marketing ranges from $10,000 to over $200,000 for a successful NFT marketing campaign.” According to <a href="https://lunarstrategy.com/what-is-the-best-marketing-budget-nft-project/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">another agency</a>, “established NFT brands can spend upwards of €100,000+ monthly on their marketing to constantly reach out to new investors and broaden their reach. Start-up projects are recommended to have between €10,000 and €25,000 if they are really looking to expose their project to as many of the right eyes as possible.” Given the lack of better promotional alternatives, we believe this market is ripe and can produce meaningful revenue. This (partially) explains why we’re starting with promoting NFTs as a wedge into the broader advertising opportunity.</p>



<p>Below is a bottom-up calculation that illustrates the potential of the market. First, let’s determine the potential ad spend per year per project. Marketing budgets for traditional B2C companies <a href="https://www.brightedge.com/glossary/define-marketing-budgets" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">typically range from 5 to 25 percent of a company’s revenue</a> or revenue targets, depending on company size, stage of growth. One <a href="https://www.bdc.ca/en/articles-tools/marketing-sales-export/marketing/what-average-marketing-budget-for-small-business" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">survey of SMBs</a> suggests that companies earning less than $2M in revenue spend $14K in online marketing. While a <a href="https://ppcexpo.com/blog/how-much-do-small-businesses-spend-on-advertising" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">2019 survey suggests</a> that SMB companies spend $10K–$50K in online advertising. Let’s assume that NFT projects have similar marketing spend, approximately $1.2K per month. That amount aligns with the marketing budgets suggested by web3 agencies for NFT projects (above).</p>



<p>Assuming there are 80,300 NFT collections, and they <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/report-over-100-increase-in-number-of-ethereum-based-nft-collections-in-2022/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">grow 30% YoY</a>, then there may be 104K NFT projects by 2023. NFT collections follow power law distributions, so most of the projects will be small $1.2K/mo advertisers, while a few (1%) will be power users with larger budgets (e.g., 10x higher, as per the web3 agency example ranges above). Therefore, we calculate:</p>



<p>(99% * 104K projects * 1.2K/mo * 12 months) +&nbsp;<br>(1% * 104K projects * 10.2K/mo * 12 months) = $1,609,920,000.</p>



<p>In the future, NFT projects will turn to trusted sources of quality advertising to reach broader yet targeted audiences, <strong>because the current alternatives are depressing</strong> – from con artists, Discord shillers, to Twitter feeds littered with these giveaways:</p>

<h3 id="c57e">Highlights</h3>

<h3 id="a59c">Challenges</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Analytics</strong>. We hypothesized that we could use <a href="./../../../institutional-capital-upgradeable-contracts/index.html">Google Analytics as a data warehouse for our prototype</a>.

<h3>Food for Thought: How much time is required to onboard a new NFT Promoter? </h3>



<p>Our current iteration is self-serve and takes about 5 minutes to deliver an ad to our users. <a href="https://app.alphaback.xyz/promotions">Try it for yourself here</a>. As a prototype, the UX is understandably rough, but all it takes is a few input fields and some USDC in your wallet <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Our prior ad:tech startup was focused on providing a self-serve product for what was traditionally an enterprise, managed service. We expect to continue that tradition at AlphaBack, enabling NFT promoters to advertise their collections to NFT enthusiasts via our self-serve interface.</p>



<p>In the future, as we build the ad network, we can plug-in to existing demand side platforms (aka “DSP”, such as Basis, TradeDesk, MediaMath, etc.). Those are the ‘media buying platforms’ for most large advertisers. Integrating our network (inventory) into a DSP means that ad buys will flow to us automatically without having to directly partner with advertisers directly.</p>



<p id="37e7">Thanks again for your ongoing support <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png" alt="🙏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> and don&#8217;t forget to <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alpha-back/oecacmanfecanoehhmhmjmpdlhffiihe">install the Browser Extension</a>&nbsp;today, which allows NFT promoters to reach users whenever they open a &#8220;new tab&#8221; on their browser.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>GM Frens <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> It was an exciting week for <a href="https://alphaback.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AlphaBack.xyz</a>. We won a hackathon and found an elegant solution to airdrop USDC to users.</p>



<p>A quick about us in case you’re new here:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>AlphaBack is building a browser extension that pays users to look at NFTs (ads), with the goal of building a DAO owned ad-network.</p></blockquote>



<p>People hate ads, and advertisers know that. But ads are not going away. In a world where users can choose between (A) look at ads and get $0 or (B) look at ads and get $255 per year from AlphaBack, we strongly believe that users will choose (B) and install our browser plug-in.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*T4U4mVTGhudbx45sBv89Lw.png" alt="Users see approximately 10,000 advertising impressions per day and get $0. In the future, AlphaBack may pay as much as $255 in airdrop USDC."/></figure>



<p>On top of monetary incentives, we give users power over their advertising experience, enabling them to give more or less of their data in exchange for more or less payment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*RkxK-UjUsQ78ennft9Ox5A.png" alt="AlphaBack airdrops USDC to users in exchange for their data sharing consent and attention."/></figure>



<p>OK, let’s jump into the weekcap for July 10–17:</p>



<h3>Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Won Hackathon!</strong> AlphaBack won 2nd place and a $5,000 prize in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6KTJVvWhng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Encode x Polygon Hackathon</em></a>. Next, we’re competing in the HackFS competition, where we may win up to $100,000 in prizes.</li><li><strong>Payment Solution</strong>. In a past retro, we noted how expensive it can be to airdrop USDC to 100K users – even on inexpensive L2 chains, like Polygon. We now have an elegant solution, where we maintain a running balance per user using read requests and an index of their last withdrawal, rather than updating state variables per user balance.</li><li><strong>Phase 2 Investor Meetings</strong>. We’re now in phase 2, aka “Investment Committee Meetings,” with <a href="./../../../institutional-capital-upgradeable-contracts/index.html">several investors</a>. We’re also getting more inbound interest via the <a href="https://stonks.com/deal/alphaback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stonks deal room</a>. We’re focusing on cap table composition, optimizing for investors who can help with tokenomics, DAO setup, access to NFT influencers, and/or ad:tech connections.</li></ul>



<h3>Obstacles</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Delayed Release</strong>. We found a bug during our pre-release QA, which delayed our deployment. We’re targeting July 20 for the next code release.</li></ul>

<p>We’re keeping this one short because the last update was long and this was a short week for the 4th of July holiday <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9e8.png" alt="🧨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> TLDR: after <a href="./../../../debuted-alphaback-at-tachyons-demo-day/index.html">presenting on the Stonks platform</a>, we received an investment from the <em>The</em> <em>Best of Stonks Fund</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We&#8217;re also testing our payments code in localhost. </p>

<h3><strong>Highlights</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Investor Interest</strong>. We continue to receive inbound interest via the <a href="https://stonks.com/deal/alphaback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stonks deal room</a>. We’ll focus on finding a lead investor that brings web3 and/or ad:tech know-how.</li><li><strong>Fundraising</strong>. We closed our first investor, <em>The</em> <em>Best of Stonks Fund</em>. Papers are executed and they wired the money <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li><li><strong>Local Testing</strong>. We began testing our next deployment in localhost, which enables us to receive and distribute payments to users <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f911.png" alt="🤑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<h3><strong>Obstacles</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Time Constrained</strong>. With so many investor meetings, there’s less time for product &amp; marketing efforts. Growth this week was inbound and organic only. We’re excited to close our round so we can push full steam ahead.</li><li><strong>Support Requests</strong>. Our Discord sever is no longer a founders’ chatroom <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Users are joining and they want to know when they’re getting paid. While explaining that payments are coming soon is an additional task, it’s also a signal that <em>somebody gives a </em><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4a9.png" alt="💩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. This is good because <em>apathy is the real startup killer</em>. Now’s the time to be patient and invite more users. #WAGMI</li></ul>



<h3><strong>How You Can Help</strong></h3>



<ul><li>We’re putting together our fundraising round. Reply if you have intros to investors who are interested in (1) a veteran team of 10Xers who’ve been working together for ten years, (2) DAO / community ownership, or (3) ad targeting in a web3, post-cookie world.</li><li>Are you familiar with any other high quality NFT conferences? We’re considering whether to sponsor another small booth so we can have more direct conversations with potential users.</li></ul>



<p>We have a long road ahead of us as we journey to 1M users. Thanks again for your ongoing support.</p>

<p>We concluded our 12-week accelerator program with a bang. On June 30, 2022, we debuted<a href="https://alphaback.xyz/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> AlphaBack.xyz</a> at Tachyon’s Demo Day using the Stonks platform.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rI2q6Sg6eEYdAYdF0f3dUg.png" alt="A screenshot of what viewers saw during Tachyon's Demo Day on June 30th."/></figure>



<h3>What is AlphaBack?</h3>



<p>With AlphaBack, users see a promoted NFT — instead of a search bar — when they open a new browser tab. Advertisers pay to promote there because users open ~50 tabs per day, averaging 3+ min. of engagement. Via smart contracts, 70% of that money goes to users and 30% goes to our DAO. In time,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>our DAO will be the biggest web3 ad / data network that’s owned by the community, for the community.</p></blockquote>



<p>The most exciting part of AlphaBack is that we have a <strong>huge opportunity to shape the future of advertising in a post-cookie, web3 world</strong>. Let’s unpack that a bit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Hn0MTJjPU0H-dLmt_6WJYQ.jpeg" alt=""/><figcaption>AlphaBack converts your “new browser tab” into an NFT-viewing experience – plus you get paid USDC if that NFT was a paid promotion.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the last ad:tech bull run, companies like BlueKai and LiveRamp built huge businesses leveraging cookies to create data targeting segments. Advertisers paid an average of $3 per 1,000 impressions (CPM) to enable targeting based on those segments, such as job titles, affinities, and more. That’s <em>on top</em> of the average $2.80 CPM for the ad placement — showing that the targeting data is just as valuable (if not more so) than the ad inventory itself. But the last five years weakened the foundations of cookie-based targeting thanks to GDPR, CCPA, and Apple’s privacy-enhancing moves. And yet advertisers will continue to crave targeting data for their ad campaigns.</p>



<h3>The Future of Ad Targeting</h3>



<p>Web3 presents an opportunity to provide appropriate targeting and privacy protections. Imagine a world where millions of AlphaBack users have connected their wallet and consented to be part of our community-owned ad network. With that, we could <strong>create a Device-ID-to-Wallet-Address graph, mapping users’ wallet activity to advertise-able devices</strong>. Unlike cookies, user wallet activity is already public on chain, and thus there should be fewer privacy concerns. Armed with such a device-to-wallet graph would enable us to <strong>sell and activate targeting data on <em>any ad network</em></strong> (such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.), in addition to our ad units on new browser tabs. That is a huge opportunity.</p>



<p>We believe that <strong>user wallet activity is the next frontier of ad targeting</strong>, which will be vastly more powerful than cookie segments inferred by user form submissions and page visits. For example, want to target DeFi users that have swapped ETH to USDC in the past 3 months? Easy. Or perhaps you want to target all users who purchased a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT for more than 50 ETH? Done. Creating <strong>targetable user personas based on <em>actual</em> wallet activity is a boon to advertisers</strong> that want to go beyond inferred age, sex, location, and income brackets. In the future, advertisers should be able to target wallet addresses that have spent 5 ETH in the last 90 days or Whales who have more than 100 ETH. That <em>certainty</em> about the targeting data is unheard of today and will unleash increased ad spend because suddenly it becomes justifiable to spend more to target higher value personas.</p>



<h3>Balancing User Privacy and Advertiser Targeting</h3>



<p>But the vision above will require the right balance between protecting privacy and leveraging user data for targeting. Enter the DAO-owned ad network — a product that’s for the community, by the community.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We believe that a community-owned and operated ad network will be best positioned to strike the necessary balance between users and advertisers because the user’s voice will be a part of the process.</p></blockquote>



<p>Users (and their data) will be more than just monetizable eyeballs; they will get to decide how much of their privacy they want to monetize — and then benefit directly from that monetization. We believe this puts the incentives in the right place, yielding a productive negotiation between Users and Advertisers.</p>



<p>We hope you are as excited as we are to create a better advertising future that’s built on mutual respect and blockchain-enabled trust.</p>



<h3>What about NFT Deals after Demo Day?</h3>



<p>NFTDeals.xyz is a front-end to an NFT auction protocol that we built. In the coming months, we’ll allow the community to determine its future direction. <a href="https://discord.gg/uKQgkteu72" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Join our Discord server</a> if you’re interested in participating in that discussion.</p>



<p>As founders, however, we will dedicate our energy to <a href="https://alphaback.xyz/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AlphaBack</a> because we believe that is the growth opportunity in this market. This means that we will not be hosting auctions ourselves in the near term. But that’s the beauty of a permissionless protocol: <em>you</em> can host an auction whenever you want without having to partner with us directly. Simply interact with the published smart contracts in our backend portal or via EtherScan!</p>



<h3>Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Fundraising.</strong> On June 30, 2022, we debuted our product at Tachyon’s Demo Day using <a href="https://stonks.com/deal/alphaback" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the Stonks platform</a>. It was an incredible event, with over 350 viewers watching the livestream. We received 23 introduction requests from investors, totaling $2M worth of interest.</li><li><strong>The Pivot, Redux</strong>. Last week we <a href="https://medium.com/nftdeals/nft-deals-week-12-retro-9d1b6c8ced8e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began exploring a soft pivot</a> where we would sell the NFT Deals’ backend tooling to major brands. But several customer interviews and investor discussions later, we learned that was not going to be the best opportunity for us in the current market. Simply stated, brands have 12- to 18-month long sales cycles that, combined with the bear market, will result in <em>limited opportunities to validate product market fit</em>. While we considered pursuing that option — akin to pushing a boulder uphill — we realized that AlphaBack’s users were growing at 155% compounded daily — like a snowball rolling downhill. Not bad given that we haven’t been actively marketing AlphaBack, besides telling people about it at NFT NYC.</li></ul>



<h3>Obstacles</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Minimizing Gas Fees.</strong> The first MVP is almost complete, with gas fee minimization for multi-call USDC payments as the final step. We don’t want to over-engineer the process, so this version will support up to 100K users. But current estimates show that it will cost approximately $172 in gas fees on Polygon to send USDC to that many users. Not ideal to say the least. We are exploring other options so that users earn as much as possible from advertisers.</li></ul>



<h3>How You Can&nbsp;Help</h3>



<ul><li>Our demo day showed us that there is <a href="./../../../institutional-capital-upgradeable-contracts/index.html">strong investor interest</a>, so we’re putting together a pre-seed round. Reply if you have intros to investors who are interested in (1) a veteran team of 10Xers who’ve been working together for ten years, (2) community ownership trends, or (3) ad targeting in a web3, post-cookie world.</li></ul>
