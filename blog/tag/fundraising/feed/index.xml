<p>This week was delightful! We released upgradeable contracts and analytics in staging, and we welcomed an institutional investor on our cap table. We&#8217;re making good progress toward onboarding our first 10,000 NFT-friendly users.</p>



<h3>Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Fundraising</strong>. We’re excited to welcome <strong>Hashkey Capital</strong> in our round, an institutional fund with over 200 portfolio companies that has been investing exclusively in blockchain technology since 2015.</li><li><strong>Upgradeable contracts</strong>. As <a href="./../../../upgradeable-contracts-more-fundraising/index.html">mentioned last week</a>, we&#8217;ve been working on upgradeable smart contracts. This week, we released that code in our staging environment. Next, we’ll conduct QA and aim for a production release in the next sprint.</li><li><strong>Analytics</strong>. We can now track connected wallets, enabling us to identify users who should receive payments for viewing NFTs <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f911.png" alt="🤑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*MmBV0wmhmicchNsavaJ4yQ.png" alt="Analytics show a user's wallet ID connected to AlphaBack, an extension that pays users to look at NFTs"/></figure>



<h3>Challenges</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Deployments</strong>. A new code package introduced conflicting dependencies. We lost two days of dev time diagnosing and fixing that issue in our staging environment. Production systems were not affected.</li></ul>



<h3>Asks</h3>



<ul><li>We’re working on user research and mockups of our next NFT discovery user experience. Signup for a <a href="https://calendly.com/rodfuentes/office-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">short user interview here</a>.</li><li>Do you know any NFT collections who would be interested in a simple win-win collaboration? We’ll promote them on AlphaBack, and they encourage their community to install our extension. Here are a few that we’re approaching:</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*jp0I-lq13J5ZJvPRVIYv-A.png" alt=""/></figure>



<h3>Food for&nbsp;Thought</h3>



<p>We’ve been thinking about traditional advertising models and how we can leverage them to provide users with more yield in the future.</p>



<p>For instance, we can empower users to <em>control</em> their advertising experience, allowing them to offer more data to advertisers in exchange for greater payments. In one scenario, users may get a multiplier on rewards if they connect more wallets. Or perhaps users opt-in to share browser activity and history, leading to another multiplier. We believe these will be rich data sources in the future (post-cookie) advertising world — and users should benefit directly from offering their data.</p>



<p>Additionally, we could reward users based on the number of ad views they generate in their typical browsing experience. Cost-per-click campaigns are also possible in the future, where users earn a percentage of each paid click. Similarly, we could introduce cost-per-action campaigns that are uniquely tied to wallet addresses, encouraging higher rewards for users and conversions for advertisers.</p>



<p>That said, we leave those ideas for future implementation because they require careful product development to prevent abuse. Any model where the user benefits from doing more of the paid activity presents a moral hazard. For example, did the user click on the ad to earn money, or were they genuinely interested in the advertised product or NFT? Fortunately, advertising fraud is an old problem with well-established methods for detecting such activity.</p>



<p>But, first things first, <em>we must grow our user base</em> to make all of this possible. So I want to thank you for your support as we climb to 1M users.</p>

<p>We’re heads down building and fundraising for our NFT promotions ad network, so here’s another quick weekcap. But first a brief intro in case you’re new here:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>AlphaBack is a browser extension that pays users to look at NFTs (ads), with the goal of building a DAO-owned ad&nbsp;network.</em></p></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="652" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Alphaback_Extension_transparent_clean-1024x652.png" alt="AlphaBack pays users to look at NFT promotions" class="wp-image-39" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Alphaback_Extension_transparent_clean-1024x652.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Alphaback_Extension_transparent_clean-300x191.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Alphaback_Extension_transparent_clean-768x489.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Alphaback_Extension_transparent_clean-1200x764.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Alphaback_Extension_transparent_clean.png 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Also, we’re experimenting with a new section on these Retros called, <em>Food for Thought</em>. Review that (at the bottom of this note) if you want to go deeper.</p>



<h3>Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Fundraising</strong>. We closed three more angel investors on our SAFE!</li><li><strong>Allocations</strong>. We’re now up to <strong>$965,000</strong> in written commitments from investors. This is a <a href="./../../../payments-code-released-fundraising-continues/index.html">10% increase over last week</a>.</li><li><strong>Upgradeable Contracts</strong>. We‘re laying the foundation for faster iterations and future flexibility via upgradeable contracts. We estimate releasing that code within 2 weeks.</li></ul>



<h3>Challenges</h3>



<ul><li><strong>HackFS Hackathon</strong>. We had planned on participating in this hackathon, but prioritizing the release of the payments code meant that we didn’t have enough time for a meaningful submission.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>How You Can&nbsp;Help</strong></h3>



<ul><li>What do you think about <strong>DevCon</strong> in Bogotá? We’re considering whether to sponsor a small booth there given the amount of foot traffic we can convert – like we did at NFT NYC. Hit reply and send me your thoughts.</li><li>Here’s an updated list of investors who’d be interested in meeting us given their web3 thesis and portfolio.

<h3>Food for Thought: NFT Promotions are hard.</h3>



<p>NFT projects continue to sprout. There are now approximately 80,300 NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain, up from 15,540 in 2021. And that doesn’t include the growing number of NFT projects on Solana. Importantly, marketing is a top expense for any NFT project.</p>



<p>A web3 marketing agency, Coinbound, says that “NFT marketing ranges from $10,000 to over $200,000 for a successful NFT marketing campaign.” According to <a href="https://lunarstrategy.com/what-is-the-best-marketing-budget-nft-project/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">another agency</a>, “established NFT brands can spend upwards of €100,000+ monthly on their marketing to constantly reach out to new investors and broaden their reach. Start-up projects are recommended to have between €10,000 and €25,000 if they are really looking to expose their project to as many of the right eyes as possible.” Given the lack of better promotional alternatives, we believe this market is ripe and can produce meaningful revenue. This (partially) explains why we’re starting with promoting NFTs as a wedge into the broader advertising opportunity.</p>



<p>Below is a bottom-up calculation that illustrates the potential of the market. First, let’s determine the potential ad spend per year per project. Marketing budgets for traditional B2C companies <a href="https://www.brightedge.com/glossary/define-marketing-budgets" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">typically range from 5 to 25 percent of a company’s revenue</a> or revenue targets, depending on company size, stage of growth. One <a href="https://www.bdc.ca/en/articles-tools/marketing-sales-export/marketing/what-average-marketing-budget-for-small-business" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">survey of SMBs</a> suggests that companies earning less than $2M in revenue spend $14K in online marketing. While a <a href="https://ppcexpo.com/blog/how-much-do-small-businesses-spend-on-advertising" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">2019 survey suggests</a> that SMB companies spend $10K–$50K in online advertising. Let’s assume that NFT projects have similar marketing spend, approximately $1.2K per month. That amount aligns with the marketing budgets suggested by web3 agencies for NFT projects (above).</p>



<p>Assuming there are 80,300 NFT collections, and they <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/report-over-100-increase-in-number-of-ethereum-based-nft-collections-in-2022/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">grow 30% YoY</a>, then there may be 104K NFT projects by 2023. NFT collections follow power law distributions, so most of the projects will be small $1.2K/mo advertisers, while a few (1%) will be power users with larger budgets (e.g., 10x higher, as per the web3 agency example ranges above). Therefore, we calculate:</p>



<p>(99% * 104K projects * 1.2K/mo * 12 months) +&nbsp;<br>(1% * 104K projects * 10.2K/mo * 12 months) = $1,609,920,000.</p>



<p>In the future, NFT projects will turn to trusted sources of quality advertising to reach broader yet targeted audiences, <strong>because the current alternatives are depressing</strong> – from con artists, Discord shillers, to Twitter feeds littered with these giveaways:</p>

<h3 id="c57e">Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Fundraising</strong>. We closed another investor on our YC SAFE, building more momentum on this financing.</li><li><strong>Allocations</strong>. We’re now up to <strong>$875,000</strong> in written commitments from investors.</li><li><strong>Deployed Payments Code</strong>. We deployed the code that takes USDC from NFT promoters and distributes payments to users <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<h3 id="a59c">Challenges</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Analytics</strong>. We hypothesized that we could use <a href="./../../../institutional-capital-upgradeable-contracts/index.html">Google Analytics as a data warehouse for our prototype</a>. While pushing data in has been simple, extracting data has been more complex than expected. We’ll try another approach this coming week. If that does not work, then we’ll need to explore other solutions.</li></ul>

<h3>Food for Thought: How much time is required to onboard a new NFT Promoter? </h3>



<p>Our current iteration is self-serve and takes about 5 minutes to deliver an ad to our users. <a href="https://app.alphaback.xyz/promotions">Try it for yourself here</a>. As a prototype, the UX is understandably rough, but all it takes is a few input fields and some USDC in your wallet <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Our prior ad:tech startup was focused on providing a self-serve product for what was traditionally an enterprise, managed service. We expect to continue that tradition at AlphaBack, enabling NFT promoters to advertise their collections to NFT enthusiasts via our self-serve interface.</p>



<p>In the future, as we build the ad network, we can plug-in to existing demand side platforms (aka “DSP”, such as Basis, TradeDesk, MediaMath, etc.). Those are the ‘media buying platforms’ for most large advertisers.

<p>GM Frens <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> It was an exciting week for <a href="https://alphaback.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AlphaBack.xyz</a>. We won a hackathon and found an elegant solution to airdrop USDC to users.</p>



<p>A quick about us in case you’re new here:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>AlphaBack is building a browser extension that pays users to look at NFTs (ads), with the goal of building a DAO owned ad-network.</p></blockquote>



<p>People hate ads, and advertisers know that. But ads are not going away. In a world where users can choose between (A) look at ads and get $0 or (B) look at ads and get $255 per year from AlphaBack, we strongly believe that users will choose (B) and install our browser plug-in.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*T4U4mVTGhudbx45sBv89Lw.png" alt="Users see approximately 10,000 advertising impressions per day and get $0. In the future, AlphaBack may pay as much as $255 in airdrop USDC."/></figure>



<p>On top of monetary incentives, we give users power over their advertising experience, enabling them to give more or less of their data in exchange for more or less payment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*RkxK-UjUsQ78ennft9Ox5A.png" alt="AlphaBack airdrops USDC to users in exchange for their data sharing consent and attention."/></figure>



<p>OK, let’s jump into the weekcap for July 10–17:</p>



<h3>Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Won Hackathon!</strong> AlphaBack won 2nd place and a $5,000 prize in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6KTJVvWhng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Encode x Polygon Hackathon</em></a>. Next, we’re competing in the HackFS competition, where we may win up to $100,000 in prizes.</li><li><strong>Payment Solution</strong>. In a past retro, we noted how expensive it can be to airdrop USDC to 100K users – even on inexpensive L2 chains, like Polygon. We now have an elegant solution, where we maintain a running balance per user using read requests and an index of their last withdrawal, rather than updating state variables per user balance.</li><li><strong>Phase 2 Investor Meetings</strong>. We’re now in phase 2, aka “Investment Committee Meetings,” with <a href="./../../../institutional-capital-upgradeable-contracts/index.html">several investors</a>. We’re also getting more inbound interest via the <a href="https://stonks.com/deal/alphaback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stonks deal room</a>. We’re focusing on cap table composition, optimizing for investors who can help with tokenomics, DAO setup, access to NFT influencers, and/or ad:tech connections.</li></ul>



<h3>Obstacles</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Delayed Release</strong>. We found a bug during our pre-release QA, which delayed our deployment. We’re targeting July 20 for the next code release.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>How You Can&nbsp;Help</strong></h3>



<ul><li>We have an updated list of investors who’d be interested in meeting us given their web3 thesis and portfolio.

<p>We’re keeping this one short because the last update was long and this was a short week for the 4th of July holiday <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9e8.png" alt="🧨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> TLDR: after <a href="./../../../debuted-alphaback-at-tachyons-demo-day/index.html">presenting on the Stonks platform</a>, we received an investment from the <em>The</em> <em>Best of Stonks Fund</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We&#8217;re also testing our payments code in localhost. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="984" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/stonks_platform_summary-1024x984.png" alt="A view of AlphaBack's deal room on the Stonks fundraising platform." class="wp-image-141" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/stonks_platform_summary-1024x984.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/stonks_platform_summary-300x288.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/stonks_platform_summary-768x738.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/stonks_platform_summary-1200x1153.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/stonks_platform_summary.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3><strong>Highlights</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Investor Interest</strong>. We continue to receive inbound interest via the <a href="https://stonks.com/deal/alphaback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stonks deal room</a>. We’ll focus on finding a lead investor that brings web3 and/or ad:tech know-how.</li><li><strong>Fundraising</strong>. We closed our first investor, <em>The</em> <em>Best of Stonks Fund</em>. Papers are executed and they wired the money <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li><li><strong>Local Testing</strong>. We began testing our next deployment in localhost, which enables us to receive and distribute payments to users <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f911.png" alt="🤑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<h3><strong>Obstacles</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Time Constrained</strong>. With so many investor meetings, there’s less time for product &amp; marketing efforts. Growth this week was inbound and organic only. We’re excited to close our round so we can push full steam ahead.</li><li><strong>Support Requests</strong>. Our Discord sever is no longer a founders’ chatroom <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Users are joining and they want to know when they’re getting paid. While explaining that payments are coming soon is an additional task, it’s also a signal that <em>somebody gives a </em><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4a9.png" alt="💩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. This is good because <em>apathy is the real startup killer</em>. Now’s the time to be patient and invite more users. #WAGMI</li></ul>



<h3><strong>How You Can Help</strong></h3>



<ul><li>We’re putting together our fundraising round. Reply if you have intros to investors who are interested in (1) a veteran team of 10Xers who’ve been working together for ten years, (2) DAO / community ownership, or (3) ad targeting in a web3, post-cookie world.</li><li>Are you familiar with any other high quality NFT conferences? We’re considering whether to sponsor another small booth so we can have more direct conversations with potential users.</li></ul>



<p>We have a long road ahead of us as we journey to 1M users. Thanks again for your ongoing support.</p>
