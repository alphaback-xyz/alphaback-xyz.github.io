<p>Weâ€™re keeping this one short because the last update was long and this was a short week for the 4th of July holiday <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9e8.png" alt="ðŸ§¨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> TLDR: after <a href="./../../../debuted-alphaback-at-tachyons-demo-day/index.html">presenting on the Stonks platform</a>, we received an investment from the <em>The</em> <em>Best of Stonks Fund</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f389.png" alt="ðŸŽ‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We&#8217;re also testing our payments code in localhost. </p>

<h3><strong>Highlights</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Investor Interest</strong>. We continue to receive inbound interest via the <a href="https://stonks.com/deal/alphaback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stonks deal room</a>. Weâ€™ll focus on finding a lead investor that brings web3 and/or ad:tech know-how.</li><li><strong>Fundraising</strong>. We closed our first investor, <em>The</em> <em>Best of Stonks Fund</em>. Papers are executed and they wired the money <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="ðŸ’ª" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li><li><strong>Local Testing</strong>. We began testing our next deployment in localhost, which enables us to receive and distribute payments to users <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f911.png" alt="ðŸ¤‘" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<h3><strong>Obstacles</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Time Constrained</strong>. With so many investor meetings, thereâ€™s less time for product &amp; marketing efforts. Growth this week was inbound and organic only. Weâ€™re excited to close our round so we can push full steam ahead.</li><li><strong>Support Requests</strong>. Our Discord sever is no longer a foundersâ€™ chatroom <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="ðŸ˜›" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Users are joining and they want to know when theyâ€™re getting paid. While explaining that payments are coming soon is an additional task, itâ€™s also a signal that <em>somebody gives a </em><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4a9.png" alt="ðŸ’©" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. This is good because <em>apathy is the real startup killer</em>. Nowâ€™s the time to be patient and invite more users. #WAGMI</li></ul>



<h3><strong>How You Can Help</strong></h3>



<ul><li>Weâ€™re putting together our fundraising round. Reply if you have intros to investors who are interested in (1) a veteran team of 10Xers whoâ€™ve been working together for ten years, (2) DAO / community ownership, or (3) ad targeting in a web3, post-cookie world.</li><li>Are you familiar with any other high quality NFT conferences? Weâ€™re considering whether to sponsor another small booth so we can have more direct conversations with potential users.</li></ul>



<p>We have a long road ahead of us as we journey to 1M users. Thanks again for your ongoing support.</p>
