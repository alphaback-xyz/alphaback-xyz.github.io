<p>Hi there <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I&#8217;ll keep this one short as I&#8217;m flying home after a week of hacking from Sandeep&#8217;s basement <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f605.png" alt="😅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<h2><strong>Highlights</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>In person</strong>. We spent the week in NY, working side-by-side in Sandeep&#8217;s basement. It felt like hitting turbo on our product sprint and evoked our garage startup days.</li><li><strong>New feature</strong>. Our new leaderboard feature is almost complete! Notable achievements include on-chain upvoting, a packaged extension (no more slow-loading URL), and a gallery of NFTs in the upvoting competition.</li><li><strong>Ten projects</strong>. Our goal was to launch the new leaderboard feature with ten projects. We now have 20 in the pipeline, 10 secured, and 5 fully onboarded. We&#8217;re excited to deliver value to them and our users very soon.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="592" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Example-1024x592.png" alt="A mockup of AlphaBack's leaderboard feature, showing onboarding requirements." class="wp-image-382" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Example-1024x592.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Example-300x174.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Example-768x444.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Example-1200x694.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Example.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Fully-onboarded projects have provided us with their desired title, description, image, and click-through URL. </figcaption></figure>



<h2><strong><strong>Obstacles</strong></strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Extension-to-Extension</strong>. We had budgeted little time to code wallet transactions from our extension. But it turns out that we had it easy in our last release, where the extension was  opening a URL that had full access to <em>ethers.js</em> for Metamask interactions. Unfortunately, we couldn&#8217;t use that framework (and other scripts) in the native extension. We spent more time than anticipated figuring out extension-to-extension communication to prompt and execute wallet transactions.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Asks</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Do you <strong>know a consumer marketer</strong>, especially one with experience going from 0-to-1 for a mobile app or extension? I&#8217;d love to get their feedback on our go-to-market plan.</li></ul>



<p>As usual, thank you for your ongoing support <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png" alt="🙏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Until next time, enjoy this gratuitous picture of my CTO kicking my butt in chess during one of our coding breaks: </p>

<h2>PunksClub&#8217;s Twitter Spaces about entrepreneurship in web3</h2>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/punksclub_io">PunksClub</a> hosted <em>Entrepreneurship and IP in web3 &#8211; BARRELX x PunksClub</em> on Sept. 6, 2022, with a runtime of 1:34:17 and 144 people tuning in.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[2/2]<br>And also:<br>&#8211; What to focus your efforts around for your product to be successful and on the market in record time <br><br>It&#39;s on Tuesday at noon EST with <a href="https://twitter.com/punksclub_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@punksclub_io</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nicolemcgrawart?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nicolemcgrawart</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/BARRELXNFT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BARRELXNFT</a> <a href="https://t.co/Fu9Yl1XNUD">https://t.co/Fu9Yl1XNUD</a></p>&mdash; VoyTech.eth (@VoyTechEth) <a href="https://twitter.com/VoyTechEth/status/1566457691064655872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Here is a summary of that Twitter Spaces.</p>



<h2>Crossroads of IP Licensing &amp; Entrepreneurship in Web3</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Nicole (@nicolemcgrawart</strong>) says the PunksClub is trying to bring the CryptoPunks together to share about web3 and the projects they’re building. <strong>Nicole </strong>introduces herself as the CEO of Jupiter Group, a leader in art and tech integration. She used to own galleries, most recently in Palm Beach. Her entrepreneurship experience positions her well to launch BARRELX, an NFT project that aims to democratize aging spirits. A key aspect of that project is that BarrelX is collaborating with NFT holders to place their artwork on the barrel via IP licensing. </li><li><strong>Matt (@BARRELXER)</strong> is the CEO of All Nations Distilling. He got into the spirits game five years ago, starting with Kentucky bourbon. He&#8217;s trying to figure out how to make spirits aging accessible to more people. He got involved with BARRELX because he was looking for a solution for their barrel inventories and barrel management system. He wasn&#8217;t looking for a web3 solution specifically, but the blockchain technology just fit well.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="619" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-2-1024x619.png" alt="Co-founder Matt from BARRELX offers lessons from his entrepreneurship in web3." class="wp-image-368" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-2-1024x619.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-2-300x181.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-2-768x464.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-2-1200x725.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-2.png 1527w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<ul><li>An important part of entrepreneurship in web3 is understanding the intellectual property landscape. Queue <strong>Vivek</strong> (@jayaram_vivek), who has advised artists on the importance of IP over the last couple of decades. NFTs provide a novel and unique opportunity to experiment with IP licensing, sub-licensing, and other interesting IP collaborations.</li><li><strong>VoyTech.eth</strong> thinks crypto is exciting because it reset the clock on finance, where nobody can stop you from doing a blockchain transaction. But beware: <strong>Vivek</strong> notes that copyright and trademark laws have not changed since the onset of crypto. The last few years have pushed lawyers into this space to figure out how federal laws will apply to these new uses. Folks in the crypto and art communities are excited about projects providing commercial licensing to the NFT holders. Since BAYC released their license, many other projects have used similar structures. But the burden is on the communities to figure out how existing laws can be applied to this new medium.</li><li><strong>Vivek</strong> notes that the lobbying (to foster creativity and innovation in crypto) appears to be working. There will be regulation addressing cryptocurrencies, but they won&#8217;t be catastrophic or harmful to the community. </li></ul>



<h2>Surviving entrepreneurship in web3</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Nicole</strong> says building a web3 product has been crazy. It has taken a lot of learning and iteration. But they’re happy where they are now, having built a team that executes together well. </li><li><strong>Matt</strong> has been building manufacturing facilities for a long time, starting in his mother in law’s basement. He started in a 2,500 square foot space, which grew into one of the largest facilities in the country. It has taken him five years to build a manufacturing facility because regulators (local and state) have their hands in what you’re doing. The hard part is finding the right people. Failures are great to motivate you and narrow potential screw ups. As the tech industry matures, they’ll have more service providers. </li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>It&#8217;s inevitable that entrepreneurs in web3 will disrupt brick and mortar industries. Over the next decade, we&#8217;re going to see the proliferation of hybrid spaces between the metaverse and the real world.</p><cite>Matt (@BARRELXER)</cite></blockquote></figure>



<ul><li><strong>VoyTech.eth</strong> notes that key attributes of a web3 entrepreneur are persistent grit. In contrast to building manufacturing facilities, you can test ideas in crypto via mockups. You can get the product out in two weeks, put it in front of users, and see if it actually works. Web3 is all about quick validation.</li><li><strong>foreverpunks.eth</strong> is another entrepreneur in web3. He focuses on the Forever Punk product, which is within their scope as a one-man coder. He&#8217;s been doing it for two months, meeting the people, and it’s been good so far. The product came from a problem they were experiencing when they bought a CryptoPunk. He added features that he thought were missing.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="635" height="780" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-3.png" alt="Another example of entrepreneurship in web3: Forever Punks adds value to the NFT ecosystem." class="wp-image-369" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-3.png 635w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-3-244x300.png 244w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" /></figure>



<ul><li><strong>VoyTech.eth</strong> argues that developers should use the simplest tool for the job and get consultants to jump in and judge the set up. If you just hire an agency or external CTO, they may be making technical choices that end up costing you 10x more in the long run. </li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Working with developers is like working with a car mechanic: they do work and it&#8217;s hard to verify whether it was done right unless you&#8217;re a car expert, too.</p><cite>VoyTech.eth</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2>BARRELX, an example of entrepreneurship in Web3</h2>



<ul><li>BARRELX co-founder, Nicole, says they are building a new marketplace that&#8217;s going to democratize the aging spirits industry. Their first drop is a premium bourbon, and one 10th of a barrel equals 22 bottles.<strong> </strong>Customers can choose the mash bill, which are the ingredients that go inside the barrel to make up the bourbon. </li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="602" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-10-at-1.48.45-PM-1024x602.png" alt="BARRELX interface allows customers to select their bourbon." class="wp-image-371" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-10-at-1.48.45-PM-1024x602.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-10-at-1.48.45-PM-300x176.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-10-at-1.48.45-PM-768x451.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-10-at-1.48.45-PM-1536x902.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-10-at-1.48.45-PM-2048x1203.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-10-at-1.48.45-PM-1200x705.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-10-at-1.48.45-PM-1980x1163.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Nicole</strong> says the bourbon market is on fire because people started importing bourbon and the supply dried up. She notes that you cannot buy fractions of barrels on a marketplace anywhere.</li><li><strong>Matt</strong> notes that when they started trading barrels, they were tackling a real estate play. He learned that he would not have enough liquid to go to market. There’s 11 million barrels of liquid on the ground, and yet they could only produce 1.5M barrels a year. So they pivoted to manufacturing a plant.</li><li><strong>Matt</strong> says the spirits trade exists in a large, real world way. People are more interested in playing in that world. <strong>VoyTech.eth</strong> notes that the community aspect is what propels this space forward. Matt talks about how there’s an educational avenue to make sure everybody understands the bourbon-making process. <strong>VoyTech.eth</strong> has obtained great results from crypto-trading, but there is no physical aspect, like there is in BARRELX.</li><li><strong>Matt</strong> says there’s plenty of opportunities to collaborate with other communities – without explicitly being all about BARRELX.</li></ul>



<h2>Opportunities for collaboration among web3 entrepreneurs and communities</h2>



<ul><li><strong>VoyTech.eth</strong> notes that when he joined crypto, the main tools were Discord and Telegram; people were fragmented across many groups. It&#8217;s a shame not to leverage the communities.</li><li><strong>foreverpunks.eth</strong> is a web3 entrepreneur, and he&#8217;s having an internal debate whether to build more Punk-specific features or go wider. He&#8217;s thinking of starting a Punk podcast that interviews CryptoPunks to get their background stories. As for monetization, perhaps the podcast charges a fee to feature your Punk in a highlighted spot.</li><li><strong>VoyTech.eth</strong> wants to launch his PunksClub service for BAYC to get broader traction. The next step is a mobile app and chat. They started with social features to see if that aspect would catch on. They have Telegram and Discord bots, and they’re waiting for those companies to approve the bots so they can release a digests feature.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="971" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-4-971x1024.png" alt="PunksClub offers a CryptoPunk-centric social network application." class="wp-image-374" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-4-971x1024.png 971w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-4-285x300.png 285w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-4-768x810.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-4-1457x1536.png 1457w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-4-1200x1265.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-4.png 1510w" sizes="(max-width: 971px) 100vw, 971px" /></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Foreverpunks.eth (@foreverpunksnft)</strong> is adding features to Forever Punk on a weekly basis, but there’s no user generated content. Ultimately, usage appears to be tied to CryptoPunks activity. <strong>VoyTech.eth</strong> discusses expanding the map feature, enabling a CryptoPunk to be visible in both the home city and the destination city. </li><li><strong>VoyTech.eth</strong> highlights other roadmap items, like: giving people the ability to make their content public, a public member directory, and an events feature. Beyond the roadmap, there are many other ideas they are considering. For instance, they could set up channels to notify about specific areas of the world. All of this is made possible by web3 because without the CryptoPunks collection, it would be difficult to get the energy to build.</li></ul>



<p>That&#8217;s wrap for this Twitter Spaces Summary. I hope you enjoyed learning about entrepreneurship in web3, thanks to the PunksClub and friends!</p>

<p>GM frens, our stakeholder list is growing and Gmail is starting to complain about sender volume. As a result, future updates will be posted on <a href="./../../../category/retro/index.html">our blog</a> and sent out via a newsletter service (Mailchimp) rather than individual emails. So if you&#8217;ve been hesitantly opening my updates, here&#8217;s your chance to let them fade into the background <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f605.png" alt="😅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But if you love hearing from us, then make sure you <a href="http://eepurl.com/h4pPkz">opt-in to our email list here</a>!</p>



<h3>Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Fundraising</strong>. We received two more introductions to follower-funds and one more written commitment. All told, the end is near and we&#8217;re excited to conclude our fundraising.</li><li><strong>Exploring SSP Shortcut</strong>. We explored fulfilling ad inventory immediately by using supply side platforms (SSP). We successfully opened accounts with two SSPs – no small feat as we must meet their stringent publisher requirements.</li><li><strong>Monitoring Content Series</strong>. As you know, we published a content marketing experiment where we <a href="./../../../category/twitter-spaces-summaries/index.html">summarize popular Twitter Spaces</a>. The blog is now 37% of page views (&#8220;PV&#8221;) in the last 14 days, up 110% from the prior 14 day period. Overall traffic is up 93% in the same time period, from 188 PV to 364 PV. Our goal is to generate ~600 PV per Summary over a 12 week period to consider that experiment a scalable success.</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>Company Ops</strong>. We spent a few cycles polishing our surface areas, such as managing our signed agreements, setting up Carta for cap table management, and obtaining company insurance.</li></ul>



<h3>Challenges</h3>



<ul><li><strong>SSP Limitations</strong>. Despite opening accounts, various SSP limitations hinder our ability to take this shortcut. Instead, we&#8217;ll redouble efforts on the product leaderboard feature.</li></ul>



<h3>Asks</h3>



<ul><li>Do you know an NFT or Crypto project that&#8217;s interested in getting free exposure? Send me a note so we can collaborate with them.</li></ul>

<p>In this <em>Twitter Spaces Summary</em> (#TSS) of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Totally Uninformed Opinions on NFTs, Web3, Gaming, Tech, Startups &amp; VC</span>, hosts @EvilPlanInc, @SaylessLarry, and @jservesworld discuss NFT marketing tactics across brands, drawing comparisons to multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2>Totally Uninformed Opinions on NFT Marketing, Web3, and VC</h2>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/@EvilPlanIncCo">Evil Plan Inc.</a> hosted the daily show, Totally Uninformed Opinions on NFTs, Web3, Gaming, Tech, Startups &amp; VC on Aug. 17, 2022, with a runtime of <strong>41 hours</strong> and 6.3K people tuning in. </p>



<p>Note, the show was so long and covered various topics unrelated to NFTs. Here is a summary of that Twitter Spaces with respect to NFT and crypto.</p>



<h2>NFT Marketing is like MLM Schemes</h2>



<ul type="rich"><li><strong>Bombay</strong> highlights how he used NFT communities to build his network. Now he can help projects with NFT marketing.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Noah Patterson</strong> mentions that Azuki spent $400,000 to build and market its NFT project. The key to successful NFT marketing is getting people to buy your project via psychology.</li><li><strong>SoldierSilent</strong> says that MLM schemes have seven principles of influence. The important element is that one person influences another. It&#8217;s all about social proof where people are selling Tupperware from house to house. <strong>SoldierSilent</strong> says he would pitch to a person, and then use that person to get introductions to the rest of their network<strong>. </strong>Using MLM strategy is all about creating an obligation to buy from a person you know. </li><li><strong>Noah Patterson</strong> compares MLMs to crypto: if you buy-in at the top (e.g., first), then you can sell to the rest and capture the most value. Most projects are cookie cutter, and it all comes down to the NFT marketing. Like MLM, crypto is all about having getting your friends to see the project.</li><li><strong>CryptoBella</strong> says she watched friends spin up NFT marketing companies in the last year. <strong>Noah Patterson</strong> chides that anyone who&#8217;s been in the NFT space for more than six months is a guru NFT marketer <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<h2>Blockbuster Making Moves into NFTs</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Noah Patterson</strong> mentions that web3 is a new space that people want to become relevant in. In fact, <a href="https://retailtechinnovationhub.com/home/2022/7/25/blockbuster-back-from-the-grave-linked-with-nfts-move">there&#8217;s rumors that Blockbuster</a> is getting into the NFT space. Their advantage: people will trust the Blockbuster brand regardless of what they release.</li><li><strong>Jak</strong> believes Blockbuster will have an unlimited budget, and as a web3 project, they&#8217;ll be seeking an NFT influencer. <strong>Noah Patterson</strong> says he&#8217;d recommend someone from the gaming community (esp. fighting games) because of how many followers they have. Again, it&#8217;s all about NFT marketing.</li></ul>



<h2>PlayNFT Launches NFT Marketplace For Twitch &amp; YouTube Streamers</h2>



<ul><li><strong>CryptoBella</strong> talks about a new NFT utility platform called <a href="https://egamers.io/playnft-launches-nft-marketplace-for-twitch-youtube-streamers-worldwide/">PlayNFT</a>. It&#8217;s like Twitch or YouTube but gamers can have an NFT attached to their account so that they can sell and market their NFTs.<strong> </strong>Some 260 streamers signed up already. Users also get their own storefront for NFT marketing purposes, allowing them to offer their own branded tokens.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11-1024x576.png" alt="PlayNFT offers strong NFT marketing opportunities by enabling users to offer their own tokens in a storefront." class="wp-image-324" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11-1024x576.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11-300x169.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11-768x432.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<ul><li>Speaking about video streamers, <strong>Noah Patterson</strong> mentions that OnlyFans couldn&#8217;t get VC backing because the content was too explicit. This is an opportunity for crypto. In fact, there&#8217;s one company that offers <a href="https://www.livecoinwatch.com/price/Porn-PORN">Porn Coin</a> that compensates sex workers via an OnlyFans like clone site.</li><li><strong>CryptoBella</strong> likes the notion of a streaming platform that allows creators to control what NFTs they hold and offer.</li><li><strong>Jak</strong> mentions that OpenSea would be better off without NSFW content. At least it&#8217;s not on OpenSea&#8217;s servers because the content is technically hosted on-chain. </li><li>Speaking of NFSW, <strong>MetaRuth_Eth</strong> says she&#8217;s excited for the evolution of technology and its safety features for OnlyFans&#8217; creators. Crypto is building a safer bridge from web2 to web2.5 and eventually to web3 for women. Similarly, new platforms can track how many people come into a metaverse space for sex workers, how long patrons stood in an area, and sell the virtual space as an NFT. <strong>MetaRuth_Eth</strong> says that she sits on the Immersive Emerging Technologies committee for the Indian Women&#8217;s Chamber of Commerce, and she has been showing that organization these features, leading to new perspectives.</li></ul>



<h2>Post-Merge Consequences: Higher APR Yields and Multi-Generation NFTs</h2>



<ul><li><strong>SoldierSilent</strong> says they sat in a presentation from a Coinbase product manager on staking. Prediction: APR yields will increase 50% post merge. As a result, the industry might go from 3% &#8211; 4% APR right now to 4% &#8211; 5% after the merge.</li><li><strong>SoldierSilent</strong> talks about how the difference between POW and POS is that the staking period is undetermined. He&#8217;s getting more ETH for staking compared to now, because POW is limited by capital.</li><li><strong>Dr. Nope</strong> says the ecosystem is where it is, and at the end of the day, the Merge is going to happen. <strong>Noah Patterson</strong> asks if NFTs should take on generation-1 and generation-2 designation for NFT marketing purposes. <strong>Dr. Nope</strong> says that&#8217;s a community choice. <strong>Noah Patterson</strong> talks about how it&#8217;s like when a country reissues currency, and it&#8217;s not recognized. It&#8217;s disruptive to the market.</li><li><strong>Dr. Nope</strong> the Merge will be a slow process. It&#8217;s a mission critical item for the Ethereum Foundation, and they’re running parallel chains to check errors, among other things. The switchover will be much more anti-climatic than people seem to believe.</li><li><strong>Dr. Nope</strong> believes this is an opportunity to in on the ground floor –&nbsp;again. He predicts Ethereum will reach $4k USD per ETH. But if people want it to be a common medium of exchange, crypto needs to achieve price stability. </li></ul>



<h2>More People into Crypto Requires Stability and Lower Risk Perception</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Dr. Nope</strong> says that most people’s risk tolerance is not high, so high risk assets are not attractive. Crypto has to smooth out the volatility to get pension funds involved.</li><li><strong>SoldierSilent</strong> notes that they have been trying to bring some of their friends into NFTs. The challenge is changing the public perception of crypto; until then it&#8217;ll be a high risk asset. The industry needs to self-police and work on its public image in order to bring mass adoption. Positive, non-spammy NFT marketing plays an important role in that capacity.</li><li><strong>Noah Patterson</strong> says people are content to put money in the bank with 1% &#8211; 2% percent returns. If projects can show 5% returns reliably, that&#8217;s going to be huge. But <strong>Dr. Nope</strong> emphasizes slow, sustained growth with minimal price action is the ideal path. Separately, retailers don&#8217;t accept crypto because they’re dealing with vendors who want fiat. It&#8217;s not feasible or realistic to force high risk tolerance down the supply chain.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This week was delightful! We released upgradeable contracts and analytics in staging, and we welcomed an institutional investor on our cap table. We&#8217;re making good progress toward onboarding our first 10,000 NFT-friendly users.</p>



<h3>Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Fundraising</strong>. We’re excited to welcome <strong>Hashkey Capital</strong> in our round, an institutional fund with over 200 portfolio companies that has been investing exclusively in blockchain technology since 2015.</li><li><strong>Upgradeable contracts</strong>. As <a href="./../../../upgradeable-contracts-more-fundraising/index.html">mentioned last week</a>, we&#8217;ve been working on upgradeable smart contracts. This week, we released that code in our staging environment. Next, we’ll conduct QA and aim for a production release in the next sprint.</li><li><strong>Analytics</strong>. We can now track connected wallets, enabling us to identify users who should receive payments for viewing NFTs <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f911.png" alt="🤑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*MmBV0wmhmicchNsavaJ4yQ.png" alt="Analytics show a user's wallet ID connected to AlphaBack, an extension that pays users to look at NFTs"/></figure>



<h3>Challenges</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Deployments</strong>. A new code package introduced conflicting dependencies. We lost two days of dev time diagnosing and fixing that issue in our staging environment. Production systems were not affected.</li></ul>



<h3>Asks</h3>



<ul><li>We’re working on user research and mockups of our next NFT discovery user experience. Signup for a <a href="https://calendly.com/rodfuentes/office-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">short user interview here</a>.</li><li>Do you know any NFT collections who would be interested in a simple win-win collaboration? We’ll promote them on AlphaBack, and they encourage their community to install our extension. Here are a few that we’re approaching:</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*jp0I-lq13J5ZJvPRVIYv-A.png" alt=""/></figure>



<h3>Food for&nbsp;Thought</h3>



<p>We’ve been thinking about traditional advertising models and how we can leverage them to provide users with more yield in the future.</p>



<p>For instance, we can empower users to <em>control</em> their advertising experience, allowing them to offer more data to advertisers in exchange for greater payments. In one scenario, users may get a multiplier on rewards if they connect more wallets. Or perhaps users opt-in to share browser activity and history, leading to another multiplier. We believe these will be rich data sources in the future (post-cookie) advertising world — and users should benefit directly from offering their data.</p>



<p>Additionally, we could reward users based on the number of ad views they generate in their typical browsing experience. Cost-per-click campaigns are also possible in the future, where users earn a percentage of each paid click. Similarly, we could introduce cost-per-action campaigns that are uniquely tied to wallet addresses, encouraging higher rewards for users and conversions for advertisers.</p>



<p>That said, we leave those ideas for future implementation because they require careful product development to prevent abuse. Any model where the user benefits from doing more of the paid activity presents a moral hazard. For example, did the user click on the ad to earn money, or were they genuinely interested in the advertised product or NFT? Fortunately, advertising fraud is an old problem with well-established methods for detecting such activity.</p>



<p>But, first things first, <em>we must grow our user base</em> to make all of this possible. So I want to thank you for your support as we climb to 1M users.</p>

<p>Also, we’re experimenting with a new section on these Retros called, <em>Food for Thought</em>. Review that (at the bottom of this note) if you want to go deeper.</p>



<h3>Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Fundraising</strong>. We closed three more angel investors on our SAFE!</li><li><strong>Allocations</strong>. We’re now up to <strong>$965,000</strong> in written commitments from investors. This is a <a href="./../../../payments-code-released-fundraising-continues/index.html">10% increase over last week</a>.</li><li><strong>Upgradeable Contracts</strong>. We‘re laying the foundation for faster iterations and future flexibility via upgradeable contracts. We estimate releasing that code within 2 weeks.</li></ul>



<h3>Challenges</h3>



<ul><li><strong>HackFS Hackathon</strong>. We had planned on participating in this hackathon, but prioritizing the release of the payments code meant that we didn’t have enough time for a meaningful submission.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>How You Can&nbsp;Help</strong></h3>

<h3>Food for Thought: NFT Promotions are hard.</h3>



<p>NFT projects continue to sprout. There are now approximately 80,300 NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain, up from 15,540 in 2021. And that doesn’t include the growing number of NFT projects on Solana. Importantly, marketing is a top expense for any NFT project.</p>



<p>A web3 marketing agency, Coinbound, says that “NFT marketing ranges from $10,000 to over $200,000 for a successful NFT marketing campaign.” According to <a href="https://lunarstrategy.com/what-is-the-best-marketing-budget-nft-project/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">another agency</a>, “established NFT brands can spend upwards of €100,000+ monthly on their marketing to constantly reach out to new investors and broaden their reach. Start-up projects are recommended to have between €10,000 and €25,000 if they are really looking to expose their project to as many of the right eyes as possible.” Given the lack of better promotional alternatives, we believe this market is ripe and can produce meaningful revenue. This (partially) explains why we’re starting with promoting NFTs as a wedge into the broader advertising opportunity.</p>



<p>Below is a bottom-up calculation that illustrates the potential of the market. First, let’s determine the potential ad spend per year per project. Marketing budgets for traditional B2C companies <a href="https://www.brightedge.com/glossary/define-marketing-budgets" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">typically range from 5 to 25 percent of a company’s revenue</a> or revenue targets, depending on company size, stage of growth. One <a href="https://www.bdc.ca/en/articles-tools/marketing-sales-export/marketing/what-average-marketing-budget-for-small-business" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">survey of SMBs</a> suggests that companies earning less than $2M in revenue spend $14K in online marketing. While a <a href="https://ppcexpo.com/blog/how-much-do-small-businesses-spend-on-advertising" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">2019 survey suggests</a> that SMB companies spend $10K–$50K in online advertising. Let’s assume that NFT projects have similar marketing spend, approximately $1.2K per month. That amount aligns with the marketing budgets suggested by web3 agencies for NFT projects (above).</p>



<p>Assuming there are 80,300 NFT collections, and they <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/report-over-100-increase-in-number-of-ethereum-based-nft-collections-in-2022/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">grow 30% YoY</a>, then there may be 104K NFT projects by 2023. NFT collections follow power law distributions, so most of the projects will be small $1.2K/mo advertisers, while a few (1%) will be power users with larger budgets (e.g., 10x higher, as per the web3 agency example ranges above). Therefore, we calculate:</p>



<p>(99% * 104K projects * 1.2K/mo * 12 months) +&nbsp;<br>(1% * 104K projects * 10.2K/mo * 12 months) = $1,609,920,000.</p>



<p>In the future, NFT projects will turn to trusted sources of quality advertising to reach broader yet targeted audiences, <strong>because the current alternatives are depressing</strong> – from con artists, Discord shillers, to Twitter feeds littered with these giveaways:</p>

<h3 id="c57e">Highlights</h3>

<h3 id="a59c">Challenges</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Analytics</strong>. We hypothesized that we could use <a href="./../../../institutional-capital-upgradeable-contracts/index.html">Google Analytics as a data warehouse for our prototype</a>.

<h3>Food for Thought: How much time is required to onboard a new NFT Promoter? </h3>



<p>Our current iteration is self-serve and takes about 5 minutes to deliver an ad to our users. <a href="https://app.alphaback.xyz/promotions">Try it for yourself here</a>. As a prototype, the UX is understandably rough, but all it takes is a few input fields and some USDC in your wallet <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Our prior ad:tech startup was focused on providing a self-serve product for what was traditionally an enterprise, managed service. We expect to continue that tradition at AlphaBack, enabling NFT promoters to advertise their collections to NFT enthusiasts via our self-serve interface.</p>



<p>In the future, as we build the ad network, we can plug-in to existing demand side platforms (aka “DSP”, such as Basis, TradeDesk, MediaMath, etc.). Those are the ‘media buying platforms’ for most large advertisers. Integrating our network (inventory) into a DSP means that ad buys will flow to us automatically without having to directly partner with advertisers directly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>GM Frens <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> It was an exciting week for <a href="https://alphaback.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AlphaBack.xyz</a>. We won a hackathon and found an elegant solution to airdrop USDC to users.</p>



<p>A quick about us in case you’re new here:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>AlphaBack is building a browser extension that pays users to look at NFTs (ads), with the goal of building a DAO owned ad-network.</p></blockquote>



<p>People hate ads, and advertisers know that. But ads are not going away. In a world where users can choose between (A) look at ads and get $0 or (B) look at ads and get $255 per year from AlphaBack, we strongly believe that users will choose (B) and install our browser plug-in.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*T4U4mVTGhudbx45sBv89Lw.png" alt="Users see approximately 10,000 advertising impressions per day and get $0. In the future, AlphaBack may pay as much as $255 in airdrop USDC."/></figure>



<p>On top of monetary incentives, we give users power over their advertising experience, enabling them to give more or less of their data in exchange for more or less payment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*RkxK-UjUsQ78ennft9Ox5A.png" alt="AlphaBack airdrops USDC to users in exchange for their data sharing consent and attention."/></figure>



<p>OK, let’s jump into the weekcap for July 10–17:</p>



<h3>Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Won Hackathon!</strong> AlphaBack won 2nd place and a $5,000 prize in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6KTJVvWhng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Encode x Polygon Hackathon</em></a>. Next, we’re competing in the HackFS competition, where we may win up to $100,000 in prizes.</li><li><strong>Payment Solution</strong>. In a past retro, we noted how expensive it can be to airdrop USDC to 100K users – even on inexpensive L2 chains, like Polygon. We now have an elegant solution, where we maintain a running balance per user using read requests and an index of their last withdrawal, rather than updating state variables per user balance.</li><li><strong>Phase 2 Investor Meetings</strong>. We’re now in phase 2, aka “Investment Committee Meetings,” with <a href="./../../../institutional-capital-upgradeable-contracts/index.html">several investors</a>. We’re also getting more inbound interest via the <a href="https://stonks.com/deal/alphaback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stonks deal room</a>. We’re focusing on cap table composition, optimizing for investors who can help with tokenomics, DAO setup, access to NFT influencers, and/or ad:tech connections.</li></ul>



<h3>Obstacles</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Delayed Release</strong>. We found a bug during our pre-release QA, which delayed our deployment. We’re targeting July 20 for the next code release.</li></ul>

<p>We’re keeping this one short because the last update was long and this was a short week for the 4th of July holiday <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9e8.png" alt="🧨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> TLDR: after <a href="./../../../debuted-alphaback-at-tachyons-demo-day/index.html">presenting on the Stonks platform</a>, we received an investment from the <em>The</em> <em>Best of Stonks Fund</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We&#8217;re also testing our payments code in localhost. </p>

<h3><strong>Highlights</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Investor Interest</strong>. We continue to receive inbound interest via the <a href="https://stonks.com/deal/alphaback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stonks deal room</a>. We’ll focus on finding a lead investor that brings web3 and/or ad:tech know-how.</li><li><strong>Fundraising</strong>. We closed our first investor, <em>The</em> <em>Best of Stonks Fund</em>. Papers are executed and they wired the money <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li><li><strong>Local Testing</strong>. We began testing our next deployment in localhost, which enables us to receive and distribute payments to users <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f911.png" alt="🤑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<h3><strong>Obstacles</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Time Constrained</strong>. With so many investor meetings, there’s less time for product &amp; marketing efforts. Growth this week was inbound and organic only. We’re excited to close our round so we can push full steam ahead.</li><li><strong>Support Requests</strong>. Our Discord sever is no longer a founders’ chatroom <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Users are joining and they want to know when they’re getting paid. While explaining that payments are coming soon is an additional task, it’s also a signal that <em>somebody gives a </em><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4a9.png" alt="💩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. This is good because <em>apathy is the real startup killer</em>. Now’s the time to be patient and invite more users. #WAGMI</li></ul>



<h3><strong>How You Can Help</strong></h3>



<ul><li>We’re putting together our fundraising round. Reply if you have intros to investors who are interested in (1) a veteran team of 10Xers who’ve been working together for ten years, (2) DAO / community ownership, or (3) ad targeting in a web3, post-cookie world.</li><li>Are you familiar with any other high quality NFT conferences? We’re considering whether to sponsor another small booth so we can have more direct conversations with potential users.</li></ul>



<p>We have a long road ahead of us as we journey to 1M users. Thanks again for your ongoing support.</p>

<p>We concluded our 12-week accelerator program with a bang. On June 30, 2022, we debuted<a href="https://alphaback.xyz/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> AlphaBack.xyz</a> at Tachyon’s Demo Day using the Stonks platform.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rI2q6Sg6eEYdAYdF0f3dUg.png" alt="A screenshot of what viewers saw during Tachyon's Demo Day on June 30th."/></figure>



<h3>What is AlphaBack?</h3>



<p>With AlphaBack, users see a promoted NFT — instead of a search bar — when they open a new browser tab. Advertisers pay to promote there because users open ~50 tabs per day, averaging 3+ min. of engagement. Via smart contracts, 70% of that money goes to users and 30% goes to our DAO. In time,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>our DAO will be the biggest web3 ad / data network that’s owned by the community, for the community.</p></blockquote>



<p>The most exciting part of AlphaBack is that we have a <strong>huge opportunity to shape the future of advertising in a post-cookie, web3 world</strong>. Let’s unpack that a bit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Hn0MTJjPU0H-dLmt_6WJYQ.jpeg" alt=""/><figcaption>AlphaBack converts your “new browser tab” into an NFT-viewing experience – plus you get paid USDC if that NFT was a paid promotion.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the last ad:tech bull run, companies like BlueKai and LiveRamp built huge businesses leveraging cookies to create data targeting segments. Advertisers paid an average of $3 per 1,000 impressions (CPM) to enable targeting based on those segments, such as job titles, affinities, and more. That’s <em>on top</em> of the average $2.80 CPM for the ad placement — showing that the targeting data is just as valuable (if not more so) than the ad inventory itself. But the last five years weakened the foundations of cookie-based targeting thanks to GDPR, CCPA, and Apple’s privacy-enhancing moves. And yet advertisers will continue to crave targeting data for their ad campaigns.</p>



<h3>The Future of Ad Targeting</h3>



<p>Web3 presents an opportunity to provide appropriate targeting and privacy protections. Imagine a world where millions of AlphaBack users have connected their wallet and consented to be part of our community-owned ad network. With that, we could <strong>create a Device-ID-to-Wallet-Address graph, mapping users’ wallet activity to advertise-able devices</strong>. Unlike cookies, user wallet activity is already public on chain, and thus there should be fewer privacy concerns. Armed with such a device-to-wallet graph would enable us to <strong>sell and activate targeting data on <em>any ad network</em></strong> (such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.), in addition to our ad units on new browser tabs. That is a huge opportunity.</p>



<p>We believe that <strong>user wallet activity is the next frontier of ad targeting</strong>, which will be vastly more powerful than cookie segments inferred by user form submissions and page visits. For example, want to target DeFi users that have swapped ETH to USDC in the past 3 months? Easy. Or perhaps you want to target all users who purchased a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT for more than 50 ETH? Done. Creating <strong>targetable user personas based on <em>actual</em> wallet activity is a boon to advertisers</strong> that want to go beyond inferred age, sex, location, and income brackets. In the future, advertisers should be able to target wallet addresses that have spent 5 ETH in the last 90 days or Whales who have more than 100 ETH. That <em>certainty</em> about the targeting data is unheard of today and will unleash increased ad spend because suddenly it becomes justifiable to spend more to target higher value personas.</p>



<h3>Balancing User Privacy and Advertiser Targeting</h3>



<p>But the vision above will require the right balance between protecting privacy and leveraging user data for targeting. Enter the DAO-owned ad network — a product that’s for the community, by the community.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We believe that a community-owned and operated ad network will be best positioned to strike the necessary balance between users and advertisers because the user’s voice will be a part of the process.</p></blockquote>



<p>Users (and their data) will be more than just monetizable eyeballs; they will get to decide how much of their privacy they want to monetize — and then benefit directly from that monetization. We believe this puts the incentives in the right place, yielding a productive negotiation between Users and Advertisers.</p>



<p>We hope you are as excited as we are to create a better advertising future that’s built on mutual respect and blockchain-enabled trust.</p>



<h3>What about NFT Deals after Demo Day?</h3>



<p>NFTDeals.xyz is a front-end to an NFT auction protocol that we built. In the coming months, we’ll allow the community to determine its future direction. <a href="https://discord.gg/uKQgkteu72" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Join our Discord server</a> if you’re interested in participating in that discussion.</p>



<p>As founders, however, we will dedicate our energy to <a href="https://alphaback.xyz/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AlphaBack</a> because we believe that is the growth opportunity in this market. This means that we will not be hosting auctions ourselves in the near term. But that’s the beauty of a permissionless protocol: <em>you</em> can host an auction whenever you want without having to partner with us directly. Simply interact with the published smart contracts in our backend portal or via EtherScan!</p>



<h3>Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Fundraising.</strong> On June 30, 2022, we debuted our product at Tachyon’s Demo Day using <a href="https://stonks.com/deal/alphaback" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the Stonks platform</a>. It was an incredible event, with over 350 viewers watching the livestream. We received 23 introduction requests from investors, totaling $2M worth of interest.</li><li><strong>The Pivot, Redux</strong>. Last week we <a href="https://medium.com/nftdeals/nft-deals-week-12-retro-9d1b6c8ced8e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began exploring a soft pivot</a> where we would sell the NFT Deals’ backend tooling to major brands. But several customer interviews and investor discussions later, we learned that was not going to be the best opportunity for us in the current market. Simply stated, brands have 12- to 18-month long sales cycles that, combined with the bear market, will result in <em>limited opportunities to validate product market fit</em>. While we considered pursuing that option — akin to pushing a boulder uphill — we realized that AlphaBack’s users were growing at 155% compounded daily — like a snowball rolling downhill. Not bad given that we haven’t been actively marketing AlphaBack, besides telling people about it at NFT NYC.</li></ul>



<h3>Obstacles</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Minimizing Gas Fees.</strong> The first MVP is almost complete, with gas fee minimization for multi-call USDC payments as the final step. We don’t want to over-engineer the process, so this version will support up to 100K users. But current estimates show that it will cost approximately $172 in gas fees on Polygon to send USDC to that many users. Not ideal to say the least. We are exploring other options so that users earn as much as possible from advertisers.</li></ul>



<h3>How You Can&nbsp;Help</h3>



<ul><li>Our demo day showed us that there is <a href="./../../../institutional-capital-upgradeable-contracts/index.html">strong investor interest</a>, so we’re putting together a pre-seed round. Reply if you have intros to investors who are interested in (1) a veteran team of 10Xers who’ve been working together for ten years, (2) community ownership trends, or (3) ad targeting in a web3, post-cookie world.</li></ul>
