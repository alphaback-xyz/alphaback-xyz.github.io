<h2>NFT Morning Show: 8Aliens, The Merge, and Market Trends</h2>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/piovincenzo_">Pio.eth</a> hosted the NFT Morning Radio on Aug. 15, 2022, with a runtime of 1:33:39 and 6.3K people tuning in.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/PA2sIeHwUT">https://t.co/PA2sIeHwUT</a></p>&mdash; Pio.eth (@piovincenzo_) <a href="https://twitter.com/piovincenzo_/status/1559525419090690048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Here is a summary of that Twitter Spaces.</p>



<h2>Are you buying 8Aliens?</h2>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/allnick">NFTNick.eth</a></strong> notes that he exited his positions. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> asks if he&#8217;s looking at buying anything on the NFT side. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> says no. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> talks about <strong>8Aliens</strong>, and jokes whether it can take over Bored Apes <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f606.png" alt="😆" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1024x614.png" alt="8Aliens are collectible, interactive NFTs you can chat with." class="wp-image-199" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1024x614.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-300x180.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-768x461.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1536x922.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-2048x1229.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1200x720.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1980x1188.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Each Alien and its associated interactions are generated by algorithms and our Artificial Intelligence.</figcaption></figure>



<ul><li><strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> says he&#8217;s looking for a discount on the top end of the NFT market. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> mentions that 8aliens was a project that caused Nick to raise his eyebrow on the YouTube show. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> deflects critiques that it was outrageous for his show to suggest that 8aliens (an NFT project with 10,000 supply) would go down in price.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>8Aliens has been created by Heptalabs a team of 7 artists and engineers working on turning NFTs into interactive experiences</p><cite>8Aliens OpenSea Description</cite></blockquote></figure>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/SpeculatorArt">Kix.eth</a></strong> says he trashed allow-lists during the bull market, but he likes how 8aliens ensured a good portion of the NFTs were going to people that were bullish or invested in the project. A lot of the free mints get bought by multi wallets and sell at whatever price they want. <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/jesseshalfon">Jesse Halfon</a></strong> talks about how the people that made money were in their discord. </li><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> notes that the most bullish thing for an NFT project is taking legit venture capital money. He mentions how the first bull run in the NFT space would be a fine art bull run and full adoption by the traditional art world.</li></ul>



<h2>NFT Market Trends Report</h2>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/_thesignal">Signal (she/her)</a></strong> notes that overnight trading volume is 14.6 million, down from 25 million. She is seeing a pullback across the market, with BAYC at 79, MAYC at 13.7, and CryptoPunks at 69. <strong>Signal </strong>says the overall crypto is doing well, but the OpenSea volume is down in the mid teens.</li><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> mentions that <a href="https://axie.substack.com/">Axie Infinity</a> has removed token rewards from its classic game mode to attract users to a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/axie-infinity-cuts-rewards-from-classic-game-subtly-forcing-p2e-players-to-new-mode">new game mode</a>. </li><li><strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> notes that authorities arrested a developer who wrote code for Tornado Cash.</li></ul>



<h2>How will the Merge impact NFTs?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Kix.eth</strong> considers a theory suggesting that ETH tops out at $2,200 USD per ETH. <strong>Kix.eth</strong> says the market may be seeing money out in the blue chip NFT projects based on his gut feeling.</li><li><strong>Node</strong> says he put in a couple of offers on different Clone X NFTs.</li><li><strong>Jesse Halfon</strong> offers technical non-analysis, saying ETH is going back to $1200 USD for a couple of months.<strong> </strong>But 2022 is the year of ETH –&nbsp;The Merge is coming. ETH is under-appreciated relative to the technicals, 2021 was the &#8220;Year of NFTs,&#8221; and &#8220;Bitcoin is for Boomers.&#8221; Narrative matters. </li><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> says there&#8217;s a case to be made for sure, and there&#8217;s a lot of uncertainty around The Merge and its impact on price. </li><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/xBenJamminx">BenJammin.eth</a></strong> notes that they’re seeing an NFT bleed after people get excited for prices rising. With the Merge scheduled a month from now, people want to stack ETH because they believe the price will climb due to the Merge. We&#8217;ll likely see more NFT bleeding until then.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-left"><blockquote><p>focus on artists or creators that are trying to grow, rather than aping into NFT degen mints that are likely going to zero.</p><cite><strong>BenJammin.eth</strong></cite></blockquote></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> says it’s hard to identify which artists are favored by the market, but if you strike gold with that, you’ll get rewarded. </li><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/sgsand1">Spencer Gordon-Sand</a></strong> (&#8220;Spencer&#8221;) notes that they’ve been thinking about what happens post-Merge, and he feels giga-bearish on the NFT markets after the Merge. <strong>Spencer</strong> is surprised how well NFT markets have held up, and believes the markets have not seen true capitulation yet. He&#8217;s looking to enter positions on dumps and pick up large positions in a lot of blue chip NFTs.</li><li><strong>Kix.eth</strong> jokes that he&#8217;s going to create a narrative around the proof of work NFTs. Then he&#8217;s going to accumulate a bunch of CryptoPunks, Art Blocks, Bored Apes, and make millions.</li></ul>



<h2>Which NFTs are worth buying? Which NFTs are scams?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> talks about how there&#8217;s interest in Clone X succeeding because it was acquired for a lot of money by Nike. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> says he&#8217;s not bullish on [most?] NFT projects because they&#8217;ve taken money and not doing anything. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> notes that he could make a case that Moonbirds is a web3 business so long as Kevin Rose stays interested.</li><li><strong><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/depechenode_">Node</a></strong>&#8216;s Twitter Poll shows that 60% of people who voted said that it was the most likely &#8220;Top Tier&#8221; project to fade into obscurity.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="600" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-9.png" alt="Azuki starts with a collection of 10,000 avatars that give you membership access to The Garden: a corner of the internet where artists, builders, and web3 enthusiasts meet to create a decentralized future." class="wp-image-220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-9.png 600w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-9-300x300.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-9-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption>The Azuki NFT project is considered a top tier collection, but some question its long-term viability.</figcaption></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> says they&#8217;ve seen loyal communities to projects that were scams. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> mentions that 90% of communities have been loyal to scams. <strong>Node</strong> talks about how there&#8217;s loyalty for projects that never crack one ETH. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> inquires if Azuki raised venture money. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> notes that there&#8217;s plenty of people that took money out, and there&#8217;s stories of misuse of capital. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> talks about how there&#8217;s a bunch of people who took advantage of the market and operated without integrity.</li></ul>



<h2>What signal do VCs convey when they invest in an NFT collection?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Node</strong> says the market is where it was in 2021. <strong>Spencer</strong> says he has mixed feelings on whether VC investment mean it&#8217;s a rug or not.<strong> </strong>He&#8217;s seen VC funded projects that tend to sell more new collections.Their incentive is to hit revenue and get acquired.</li><li><strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> talks about how VCs have been dumping on retail consumers via tokens, so integrity is a spectrum. <strong>Kix.eth</strong> says they agree with <strong>Pio.eth</strong>: if VCs invest in an NFT company, it means you can take the rug risk off the table because they&#8217;re betting on their own. <strong>Kix.eth</strong> mentions that Nike is making sure this is a legit operating team.</li><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> notes that they are sick of NFT projects taking 80% of the primary sale funds and not hiring people. <strong>BenJammin.eth</strong> mentions that it’s a level of patience since hiring 40 to 50 people would take a while.</li></ul>

<h2>NFT Daily Summary, The Merge, and Chimpers NFT</h2>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/farokh/status/1558098734981988355">@Farokh</a> hosted RUG RADIO <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f399.png" alt="🎙" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />: GM NFTs <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2600.png" alt="☀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> on Aug. 12, 2022, with a runtime of 1:34:22 and 2.9K people tuning in.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Here is a summary of that Twitter Spaces.</p>



<h2>Intro &amp; NFT Daily Summary</h2>



<ul><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;wonders where his co-hosts are, roasting <strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong> for a few minutes because he was late <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </li><li>The <a href="https://linktr.ee/rugradio">Rug Radio</a> show starts with a macro and NFT daily summary.  <strong>@Farokh</strong> notes that Ethereum is looking strong and the NFT market is heating up; it&#8217;s fun.&nbsp;He adds that Chimpers NFT team will join them on stage. </li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;jokes that he canceled Pio.eth&#8217;s show earlier that morning.&nbsp;<strong>Pio.eth (@piovincenzo_)</strong>&nbsp;said the Twitter Spaces audio wasn’t working and had to move the show to Discord audio, but it was not good –&nbsp;with about 50% audience drop-off.</li><li><strong>OSF (@osf_nft)</strong>&nbsp;gives the daily market report. He mentions that:<ul><li>there was a sell off in tech stocks</li></ul><ul><li>Bitcoin was flirting with 25k yesterday, and ETH is out performing everything.</li><li>the ETH Merge is being planned for the 15th or 16 September.</li><li>mentions that the proof of work involves a series of algorithms that validate transactions on their own rig, and miners get paid for performing those calculations</li><li>some miners may create a copy of the current network and continue running it as a proof of work methodology, which will duplicate all of the existing ERC tokens, NFTs, etc</li></ul></li></ul>



<h2>What does the ETH Merge mean for your NFTs?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;notes that people have been buying Ethereum classic since the Merge became more on the horizon.</li><li><strong><strong>OSF (@osf_nft)</strong></strong>&nbsp;if miners fork Ethereum now, it will have all the transactions as of the fork&#8217;s date. He adds: <ul><li>Beware of replay attack, where you can replicate a transaction on proof of work from proof of work to proof of stake.&nbsp;</li><li>There&#8217;s a risk you end up selling your Ape on the <em>real</em> ETH proof of stake network at five Eth if you did that transaction on the forked proof of work chain.</li><li>Potential solution: transfer your NFTs on proof of work to a new wallet, and then sell it to minimize the risk of a replay attack.</li><li>Forked POW NFTs should be worth zero, but there may be a market for them. People love meme stuff.</li></ul></li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="772" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png" alt="Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake, accord. 3iQ Research Group.

<ul><li><strong>Simon (@Simon_Goldberg)</strong>&nbsp;notes that marketplaces (like OpenSea) have to support proof of work to buy or sell NFTs.</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;notes that there&#8217;s always going to be proof work miners on the chain.</li><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;notes that old chains might have some value.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>KΞNOBI (@KenobiDesigns)</strong> inquires if they will have to change terms of service to assign the right IP rights to things.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Simon (@Simon_Goldberg)</strong>&nbsp;mentions that the contract owner will still have access to that contract on proof of work. Project creators have access to the metadata, and if they change one contract, they&#8217;d be able to remove all the data for that chain.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;says they need a long form conversation about the Merge.</li></ul>



<h2>NFT Market Trends</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;mentions that the last three days have been 20 to 25 million volume, which sounds low but is up 60% from the lows of the last month.

<ul><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;says the vast majority of stuff is down over the last seven days, and every single mid tier projects is down 5 to 10%.&nbsp;Bored Apes are flat and CryptoPunks are relatively flat, but the top tier stuff is still holding. Some mid-tier projects are up: Penguins are up 50%. CryptoDickButts are up 60%. </li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;notes that there&#8217;s been a lot of fun stuff you could get in on, and new projects are cracking up.&nbsp;<strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;notes that they&#8217;ve had multiple sweeps over the last couple of weeks, and they don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re going back into USDC because of the pump or just holding on to the ETH.</li><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;says if volume returns to a seasoned project, it’s getting sold into.&nbsp;He notes that there’s only very few projects out there, and when they see a pump, a lot of people will use this opportunity to sell. Mando says that the overall markets in OpenSea volumes are at 200 million in volume, which would show a bottoming of the NFT market.&nbsp;If OS does the same volume as July, that would be a good sign.</li></ul>



<h2>Building NFT Brands in the Bear Market</h2>



<ul><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;talks about how every pump brings on more listings, and every time your project goes up in value, there’s going to be a lot of people that are going to rush the list.&nbsp;He mentions that it’s going to be more work on the founder side this time around.&nbsp;Farokh&nbsp;notes that being a genuine founder in NFT isn’t easy at the moment, spending 100 plus hours a week trying to create value for holders, and any impact of work gets immediately sold.</li><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;notes that often the projects which are showing value are the ones which continue to deliver.&nbsp;He&nbsp;mentions that it makes sense that people want to secure their finances more during this period.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;mentions that the market is so small, it&#8217;s complicated to the average person, and they need to go to the toilet three times.&nbsp;Farokh&nbsp;notes that if the month of August is just a month of uncertainty, it&#8217;s just a month of people really need liquidity.</li><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;notes that they&#8217;ve been given more opportunities to invest in startups in the space.&nbsp;It&#8217;s difficult to assess value and business plans.&nbsp;Mando says they often don&#8217;t know if a project isn&#8217;t doing well, and if they have the right founders, they can reenergize.&nbsp;The concept of 99% of projects going to zero means that 99% of founders are going to fail. Failure is going to have to be accepted. They would love to see a project which doesn’t feel like it’s hitting the right tone when it comes to the utility. They’d rather the whole community migrate to a new utility.</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;notes that a lot of people forget that building the community is one part and nurturing that community is the second part.&nbsp;It&#8217;s about being around and showing up.</li><li><strong>OSF (@osf_nft)</strong>&nbsp;says a lot of it comes down to how much money you took in upfront and what you stated you would do with that money. There are other ways you can drive value back to that project. <strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;says that someone in their Discord built a model evaluation showing Rug Radio was valued at $60 million.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>OSF (@osf_nft)</strong>&nbsp;talks about how it took them a year to bring their project back to a level they were at.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;notes that if you raise money last year and you&#8217;re giving up now, then you never had it.</li><li><strong>Ser Joey (@PunkHot10)</strong>&nbsp;says they understand that the duty to carry on and try is to increase revenue and profit, but people fail a lot within that.</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;notes how Ser Joey used to run a weekly chart where trending punks were voted on.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>GM, GA, and GN! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We&#8217;re pleased to announce that Commonwealth Asset Management (CWAM) joined our cap table <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Further, we laid the foundation of our growth marketing engine this week. More on that in the Highlights section, so keep reading!</p>



<h3>Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Fundraising</strong>. CWAM, a Los Angeles based asset management platform with $1.7B in assets and 27 team members, joined our cap table. We&#8217;re excited to partner with their crypto-focused team, bringing us just past $1.6M in written commitments. We&#8217;ll allocate the remaining $385,000 in the next few weeks, and soon we&#8217;ll wrap up fundraising to focus 100% on product and growth marketing <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li><li><strong>Won Pitch Competition</strong>. We competed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy7z7LekQgg&amp;t=1690s">Blockrocket&#8217;s monthly startup pitch competition</a> and won 1st Place!  </li><li><strong>Launched Blog</strong>. We migrated from Medium to our own blog, hosted in our domain&#8217;s subdirectory for maximum SEO and to generate inbound traffic. You&#8217;ll see <a href="./../../../koala-bot-club-talks-game-automation/index.html">more posts there</a>, as we turn on our growth marketing engine.</li><li><strong>Product Led Growth</strong>. We discussed and mocked a leaderboard feature so we can request a stronger call-to-action from NFT collections – pushing their communities to install our browser extension so that their members can upvote their NFTs. </li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="640" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-3-1024x640.png" alt="This Figma mockup shows a leaderboard feature that may power our growth marketing." class="wp-image-163" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-3-1024x640.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-3-300x188.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-3-768x480.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-3-1536x960.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-3-2048x1280.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-3-1200x750.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-3-1980x1238.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;re focusing on user growth marketing because we&#8217;re facing a classic chicken-and-egg challenge. We believe the solution is to attract a large user base in order to attract our first advertisers. Once advertisers initiate payments, we&#8217;ll pay users, which will attract more users – and thus, more advertisers.</p>



<h3>Challenges</h3>



<ul><li>None <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<h3>Asks</h3>



<ul><li>Do you know anyone who is or was at <a href="https://www.rakuten.com/sem2/button.htm">Rakuten</a> or <a href="https://honey.is/">Honey</a>? We&#8217;d love to get their insights on growth marketing and partnership strategy. </li></ul>

<p>Welcome to <a href="http://alphaback.xyz/">AlphaBack&#8217;s</a> Twitter Spaces Summaries (#TSS). In this series, we summarize Twitter Spaces that you don&#8217;t want to miss. Why? Because we all love Twitter Spaces, but dammit if they aren&#8217;t difficult to tune into at times – whether it&#8217;s the inconvenient timing or unedited / off-topic meandering. In this first post of the series, the Koala Bot Club talks about its game automation platform and its integration with the #SolSuite platform.</p>

<p>This week was delightful! We released upgradeable contracts and analytics in staging, and we welcomed an institutional investor on our cap table. We&#8217;re making good progress toward onboarding our first 10,000 NFT-friendly users.</p>



<h3>Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Fundraising</strong>. We’re excited to welcome <strong>Hashkey Capital</strong> in our round, an institutional fund with over 200 portfolio companies that has been investing exclusively in blockchain technology since 2015.</li><li><strong>Upgradeable contracts</strong>. As <a href="./../../../upgradeable-contracts-more-fundraising/index.html">mentioned last week</a>, we&#8217;ve been working on upgradeable smart contracts. This week, we released that code in our staging environment. Next, we’ll conduct QA and aim for a production release in the next sprint.</li><li><strong>Analytics</strong>. We can now track connected wallets, enabling us to identify users who should receive payments for viewing NFTs <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f911.png" alt="🤑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*MmBV0wmhmicchNsavaJ4yQ.png" alt="Analytics show a user's wallet ID connected to AlphaBack, an extension that pays users to look at NFTs"/></figure>



<h3>Challenges</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Deployments</strong>. A new code package introduced conflicting dependencies. We lost two days of dev time diagnosing and fixing that issue in our staging environment. Production systems were not affected.</li></ul>



<h3>Asks</h3>



<ul><li>We’re working on user research and mockups of our next NFT discovery user experience. Signup for a <a href="https://calendly.com/rodfuentes/office-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">short user interview here</a>.</li><li>Do you know any NFT collections who would be interested in a simple win-win collaboration? We’ll promote them on AlphaBack, and they encourage their community to install our extension. Here are a few that we’re approaching:</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*jp0I-lq13J5ZJvPRVIYv-A.png" alt=""/></figure>



<h3>Food for&nbsp;Thought</h3>



<p>We’ve been thinking about traditional advertising models and how we can leverage them to provide users with more yield in the future.</p>



<p>For instance, we can empower users to <em>control</em> their advertising experience, allowing them to offer more data to advertisers in exchange for greater payments. In one scenario, users may get a multiplier on rewards if they connect more wallets. Or perhaps users opt-in to share browser activity and history, leading to another multiplier. We believe these will be rich data sources in the future (post-cookie) advertising world — and users should benefit directly from offering their data.</p>



<p>Additionally, we could reward users based on the number of ad views they generate in their typical browsing experience. Cost-per-click campaigns are also possible in the future, where users earn a percentage of each paid click. Similarly, we could introduce cost-per-action campaigns that are uniquely tied to wallet addresses, encouraging higher rewards for users and conversions for advertisers.</p>



<p>That said, we leave those ideas for future implementation because they require careful product development to prevent abuse. Any model where the user benefits from doing more of the paid activity presents a moral hazard. For example, did the user click on the ad to earn money, or were they genuinely interested in the advertised product or NFT? Fortunately, advertising fraud is an old problem with well-established methods for detecting such activity.</p>



<p>But, first things first, <em>we must grow our user base</em> to make all of this possible. So I want to thank you for your support as we climb to 1M users.</p>

<p>We’re heads down building and fundraising for our NFT promotions ad network, so here’s another quick weekcap. But first a brief intro in case you’re new here:</p>

<p>Also, we’re experimenting with a new section on these Retros called, <em>Food for Thought</em>. Review that (at the bottom of this note) if you want to go deeper.</p>



<h3>Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Fundraising</strong>. We closed three more angel investors on our SAFE!</li><li><strong>Allocations</strong>. We’re now up to <strong>$965,000</strong> in written commitments from investors. This is a <a href="./../../../payments-code-released-fundraising-continues/index.html">10% increase over last week</a>.</li><li><strong>Upgradeable Contracts</strong>. We‘re laying the foundation for faster iterations and future flexibility via upgradeable contracts. We estimate releasing that code within 2 weeks.</li></ul>



<h3>Challenges</h3>



<ul><li><strong>HackFS Hackathon</strong>. We had planned on participating in this hackathon, but prioritizing the release of the payments code meant that we didn’t have enough time for a meaningful submission.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>How You Can&nbsp;Help</strong></h3>

<h3>Food for Thought: NFT Promotions are hard.</h3>



<p>NFT projects continue to sprout. There are now approximately 80,300 NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain, up from 15,540 in 2021. And that doesn’t include the growing number of NFT projects on Solana. Importantly, marketing is a top expense for any NFT project.</p>



<p>A web3 marketing agency, Coinbound, says that “NFT marketing ranges from $10,000 to over $200,000 for a successful NFT marketing campaign.” According to <a href="https://lunarstrategy.com/what-is-the-best-marketing-budget-nft-project/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">another agency</a>, “established NFT brands can spend upwards of €100,000+ monthly on their marketing to constantly reach out to new investors and broaden their reach. Start-up projects are recommended to have between €10,000 and €25,000 if they are really looking to expose their project to as many of the right eyes as possible.” Given the lack of better promotional alternatives, we believe this market is ripe and can produce meaningful revenue. This (partially) explains why we’re starting with promoting NFTs as a wedge into the broader advertising opportunity.</p>



<p>Below is a bottom-up calculation that illustrates the potential of the market. First, let’s determine the potential ad spend per year per project. Marketing budgets for traditional B2C companies <a href="https://www.brightedge.com/glossary/define-marketing-budgets" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">typically range from 5 to 25 percent of a company’s revenue</a> or revenue targets, depending on company size, stage of growth. One <a href="https://www.bdc.ca/en/articles-tools/marketing-sales-export/marketing/what-average-marketing-budget-for-small-business" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">survey of SMBs</a> suggests that companies earning less than $2M in revenue spend $14K in online marketing. While a <a href="https://ppcexpo.com/blog/how-much-do-small-businesses-spend-on-advertising" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">2019 survey suggests</a> that SMB companies spend $10K–$50K in online advertising. Let’s assume that NFT projects have similar marketing spend, approximately $1.2K per month. That amount aligns with the marketing budgets suggested by web3 agencies for NFT projects (above).</p>



<p>Assuming there are 80,300 NFT collections, and they <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/report-over-100-increase-in-number-of-ethereum-based-nft-collections-in-2022/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">grow 30% YoY</a>, then there may be 104K NFT projects by 2023. NFT collections follow power law distributions, so most of the projects will be small $1.2K/mo advertisers, while a few (1%) will be power users with larger budgets (e.g., 10x higher, as per the web3 agency example ranges above). Therefore, we calculate:</p>



<p>(99% * 104K projects * 1.2K/mo * 12 months) +&nbsp;<br>(1% * 104K projects * 10.2K/mo * 12 months) = $1,609,920,000.</p>



<p>In the future, NFT projects will turn to trusted sources of quality advertising to reach broader yet targeted audiences, <strong>because the current alternatives are depressing</strong> – from con artists, Discord shillers, to Twitter feeds littered with these giveaways:</p>

<p id="4f86">Hi Friends <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> this is a quick weekcap, as we’re heads down building and fundraising. Most importantly, we deployed our payments code, allowing NFT promoters to pay for ad space that is shown to users when they open a new browser tab.</p>

<h3 id="c57e">Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Fundraising</strong>. We closed another investor on our YC SAFE, building more momentum on this financing.</li><li><strong>Allocations</strong>. We’re now up to <strong>$875,000</strong> in written commitments from investors.</li><li><strong>Deployed Payments Code</strong>. We deployed the code that takes USDC from NFT promoters and distributes payments to users <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<h3 id="a59c">Challenges</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Analytics</strong>. We hypothesized that we could use <a href="./../../../institutional-capital-upgradeable-contracts/index.html">Google Analytics as a data warehouse for our prototype</a>. While pushing data in has been simple, extracting data has been more complex than expected. We’ll try another approach this coming week. If that does not work, then we’ll need to explore other solutions.</li></ul>

<h3>Food for Thought: How much time is required to onboard a new NFT Promoter? </h3>



<p>Our current iteration is self-serve and takes about 5 minutes to deliver an ad to our users. <a href="https://app.alphaback.xyz/promotions">Try it for yourself here</a>. As a prototype, the UX is understandably rough, but all it takes is a few input fields and some USDC in your wallet <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Our prior ad:tech startup was focused on providing a self-serve product for what was traditionally an enterprise, managed service. We expect to continue that tradition at AlphaBack, enabling NFT promoters to advertise their collections to NFT enthusiasts via our self-serve interface.</p>



<p>In the future, as we build the ad network, we can plug-in to existing demand side platforms (aka “DSP”, such as Basis, TradeDesk, MediaMath, etc.). Those are the ‘media buying platforms’ for most large advertisers. Integrating our network (inventory) into a DSP means that ad buys will flow to us automatically without having to directly partner with advertisers directly.</p>

<p>GM Frens <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f44b.png" alt="👋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> It was an exciting week for <a href="https://alphaback.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AlphaBack.xyz</a>. We won a hackathon and found an elegant solution to airdrop USDC to users.</p>



<p>A quick about us in case you’re new here:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>AlphaBack is building a browser extension that pays users to look at NFTs (ads), with the goal of building a DAO owned ad-network.</p></blockquote>



<p>People hate ads, and advertisers know that. But ads are not going away. In a world where users can choose between (A) look at ads and get $0 or (B) look at ads and get $255 per year from AlphaBack, we strongly believe that users will choose (B) and install our browser plug-in.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*T4U4mVTGhudbx45sBv89Lw.png" alt="Users see approximately 10,000 advertising impressions per day and get $0. In the future, AlphaBack may pay as much as $255 in airdrop USDC."/></figure>



<p>On top of monetary incentives, we give users power over their advertising experience, enabling them to give more or less of their data in exchange for more or less payment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*RkxK-UjUsQ78ennft9Ox5A.png" alt="AlphaBack airdrops USDC to users in exchange for their data sharing consent and attention."/></figure>



<p>OK, let’s jump into the weekcap for July 10–17:</p>



<h3>Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Won Hackathon!</strong> AlphaBack won 2nd place and a $5,000 prize in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6KTJVvWhng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Encode x Polygon Hackathon</em></a>. Next, we’re competing in the HackFS competition, where we may win up to $100,000 in prizes.</li><li><strong>Payment Solution</strong>. In a past retro, we noted how expensive it can be to airdrop USDC to 100K users – even on inexpensive L2 chains, like Polygon. We now have an elegant solution, where we maintain a running balance per user using read requests and an index of their last withdrawal, rather than updating state variables per user balance.</li><li><strong>Phase 2 Investor Meetings</strong>. We’re now in phase 2, aka “Investment Committee Meetings,” with <a href="./../../../institutional-capital-upgradeable-contracts/index.html">several investors</a>. We’re also getting more inbound interest via the <a href="https://stonks.com/deal/alphaback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stonks deal room</a>. We’re focusing on cap table composition, optimizing for investors who can help with tokenomics, DAO setup, access to NFT influencers, and/or ad:tech connections.</li></ul>



<h3>Obstacles</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Delayed Release</strong>. We found a bug during our pre-release QA, which delayed our deployment. We’re targeting July 20 for the next code release.</li></ul>

<p>We’re keeping this one short because the last update was long and this was a short week for the 4th of July holiday <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9e8.png" alt="🧨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> TLDR: after <a href="./../../../debuted-alphaback-at-tachyons-demo-day/index.html">presenting on the Stonks platform</a>, we received an investment from the <em>The</em> <em>Best of Stonks Fund</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We&#8217;re also testing our payments code in localhost. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="984" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/stonks_platform_summary-1024x984.png" alt="A view of AlphaBack's deal room on the Stonks fundraising platform." class="wp-image-141" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/stonks_platform_summary-1024x984.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/stonks_platform_summary-300x288.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/stonks_platform_summary-768x738.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/stonks_platform_summary-1200x1153.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/stonks_platform_summary.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3><strong>Highlights</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Investor Interest</strong>. We continue to receive inbound interest via the <a href="https://stonks.com/deal/alphaback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stonks deal room</a>. We’ll focus on finding a lead investor that brings web3 and/or ad:tech know-how.</li><li><strong>Fundraising</strong>. We closed our first investor, <em>The</em> <em>Best of Stonks Fund</em>. Papers are executed and they wired the money <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li><li><strong>Local Testing</strong>. We began testing our next deployment in localhost, which enables us to receive and distribute payments to users <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f911.png" alt="🤑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<h3><strong>Obstacles</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Time Constrained</strong>. With so many investor meetings, there’s less time for product &amp; marketing efforts. Growth this week was inbound and organic only. We’re excited to close our round so we can push full steam ahead.</li><li><strong>Support Requests</strong>. Our Discord sever is no longer a founders’ chatroom <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Users are joining and they want to know when they’re getting paid. While explaining that payments are coming soon is an additional task, it’s also a signal that <em>somebody gives a </em><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4a9.png" alt="💩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. This is good because <em>apathy is the real startup killer</em>. Now’s the time to be patient and invite more users. #WAGMI</li></ul>



<h3><strong>How You Can Help</strong></h3>



<ul><li>We’re putting together our fundraising round. Reply if you have intros to investors who are interested in (1) a veteran team of 10Xers who’ve been working together for ten years, (2) DAO / community ownership, or (3) ad targeting in a web3, post-cookie world.</li><li>Are you familiar with any other high quality NFT conferences? We’re considering whether to sponsor another small booth so we can have more direct conversations with potential users.</li></ul>



<p>We have a long road ahead of us as we journey to 1M users. Thanks again for your ongoing support.</p>

<p>We concluded our 12-week accelerator program with a bang. On June 30, 2022, we debuted<a href="https://alphaback.xyz/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> AlphaBack.xyz</a> at Tachyon’s Demo Day using the Stonks platform.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rI2q6Sg6eEYdAYdF0f3dUg.png" alt="A screenshot of what viewers saw during Tachyon's Demo Day on June 30th."/></figure>



<h3>What is AlphaBack?</h3>



<p>With AlphaBack, users see a promoted NFT — instead of a search bar — when they open a new browser tab. Advertisers pay to promote there because users open ~50 tabs per day, averaging 3+ min. of engagement. Via smart contracts, 70% of that money goes to users and 30% goes to our DAO. In time,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>our DAO will be the biggest web3 ad / data network that’s owned by the community, for the community.</p></blockquote>



<p>The most exciting part of AlphaBack is that we have a <strong>huge opportunity to shape the future of advertising in a post-cookie, web3 world</strong>. Let’s unpack that a bit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Hn0MTJjPU0H-dLmt_6WJYQ.jpeg" alt=""/><figcaption>AlphaBack converts your “new browser tab” into an NFT-viewing experience – plus you get paid USDC if that NFT was a paid promotion.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the last ad:tech bull run, companies like BlueKai and LiveRamp built huge businesses leveraging cookies to create data targeting segments. Advertisers paid an average of $3 per 1,000 impressions (CPM) to enable targeting based on those segments, such as job titles, affinities, and more. That’s <em>on top</em> of the average $2.80 CPM for the ad placement — showing that the targeting data is just as valuable (if not more so) than the ad inventory itself. But the last five years weakened the foundations of cookie-based targeting thanks to GDPR, CCPA, and Apple’s privacy-enhancing moves. And yet advertisers will continue to crave targeting data for their ad campaigns.</p>



<h3>The Future of Ad Targeting</h3>



<p>Web3 presents an opportunity to provide appropriate targeting and privacy protections. Imagine a world where millions of AlphaBack users have connected their wallet and consented to be part of our community-owned ad network. With that, we could <strong>create a Device-ID-to-Wallet-Address graph, mapping users’ wallet activity to advertise-able devices</strong>. Unlike cookies, user wallet activity is already public on chain, and thus there should be fewer privacy concerns. Armed with such a device-to-wallet graph would enable us to <strong>sell and activate targeting data on <em>any ad network</em></strong> (such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.), in addition to our ad units on new browser tabs. That is a huge opportunity.</p>



<p>We believe that <strong>user wallet activity is the next frontier of ad targeting</strong>, which will be vastly more powerful than cookie segments inferred by user form submissions and page visits. For example, want to target DeFi users that have swapped ETH to USDC in the past 3 months? Easy. Or perhaps you want to target all users who purchased a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT for more than 50 ETH? Done. Creating <strong>targetable user personas based on <em>actual</em> wallet activity is a boon to advertisers</strong> that want to go beyond inferred age, sex, location, and income brackets. In the future, advertisers should be able to target wallet addresses that have spent 5 ETH in the last 90 days or Whales who have more than 100 ETH. That <em>certainty</em> about the targeting data is unheard of today and will unleash increased ad spend because suddenly it becomes justifiable to spend more to target higher value personas.</p>



<h3>Balancing User Privacy and Advertiser Targeting</h3>



<p>But the vision above will require the right balance between protecting privacy and leveraging user data for targeting. Enter the DAO-owned ad network — a product that’s for the community, by the community.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We believe that a community-owned and operated ad network will be best positioned to strike the necessary balance between users and advertisers because the user’s voice will be a part of the process.</p></blockquote>



<p>Users (and their data) will be more than just monetizable eyeballs; they will get to decide how much of their privacy they want to monetize — and then benefit directly from that monetization. We believe this puts the incentives in the right place, yielding a productive negotiation between Users and Advertisers.</p>



<p>We hope you are as excited as we are to create a better advertising future that’s built on mutual respect and blockchain-enabled trust.</p>



<h3>What about NFT Deals after Demo Day?</h3>



<p>NFTDeals.xyz is a front-end to an NFT auction protocol that we built. In the coming months, we’ll allow the community to determine its future direction. <a href="https://discord.gg/uKQgkteu72" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Join our Discord server</a> if you’re interested in participating in that discussion.</p>



<p>As founders, however, we will dedicate our energy to <a href="https://alphaback.xyz/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AlphaBack</a> because we believe that is the growth opportunity in this market. This means that we will not be hosting auctions ourselves in the near term. But that’s the beauty of a permissionless protocol: <em>you</em> can host an auction whenever you want without having to partner with us directly. Simply interact with the published smart contracts in our backend portal or via EtherScan!</p>



<h3>Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Fundraising.</strong> On June 30, 2022, we debuted our product at Tachyon’s Demo Day using <a href="https://stonks.com/deal/alphaback" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the Stonks platform</a>. It was an incredible event, with over 350 viewers watching the livestream. We received 23 introduction requests from investors, totaling $2M worth of interest.</li><li><strong>The Pivot, Redux</strong>. Last week we <a href="https://medium.com/nftdeals/nft-deals-week-12-retro-9d1b6c8ced8e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began exploring a soft pivot</a> where we would sell the NFT Deals’ backend tooling to major brands. But several customer interviews and investor discussions later, we learned that was not going to be the best opportunity for us in the current market. Simply stated, brands have 12- to 18-month long sales cycles that, combined with the bear market, will result in <em>limited opportunities to validate product market fit</em>. While we considered pursuing that option — akin to pushing a boulder uphill — we realized that AlphaBack’s users were growing at 155% compounded daily — like a snowball rolling downhill. Not bad given that we haven’t been actively marketing AlphaBack, besides telling people about it at NFT NYC.</li></ul>



<h3>Obstacles</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Minimizing Gas Fees.</strong> The first MVP is almost complete, with gas fee minimization for multi-call USDC payments as the final step. We don’t want to over-engineer the process, so this version will support up to 100K users. But current estimates show that it will cost approximately $172 in gas fees on Polygon to send USDC to that many users. Not ideal to say the least. We are exploring other options so that users earn as much as possible from advertisers.</li></ul>



<h3>How You Can&nbsp;Help</h3>



<ul><li>Our demo day showed us that there is <a href="./../../../institutional-capital-upgradeable-contracts/index.html">strong investor interest</a>, so we’re putting together a pre-seed round. Reply if you have intros to investors who are interested in (1) a veteran team of 10Xers who’ve been working together for ten years, (2) community ownership trends, or (3) ad targeting in a web3, post-cookie world.</li></ul>
