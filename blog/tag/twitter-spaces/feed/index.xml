<p>In this <em>Twitter Spaces Summary</em> (#TSS) of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Totally Uninformed Opinions on NFTs, Web3, Gaming, Tech, Startups &amp; VC</span>, hosts @EvilPlanInc, @SaylessLarry, and @jservesworld discuss NFT marketing tactics across brands, drawing comparisons to multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2>Totally Uninformed Opinions on NFT Marketing, Web3, and VC</h2>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/@EvilPlanIncCo">Evil Plan Inc.</a> hosted the daily show, Totally Uninformed Opinions on NFTs, Web3, Gaming, Tech, Startups &amp; VC on Aug. 17, 2022, with a runtime of <strong>41 hours</strong> and 6.3K people tuning in. </p>



<p>Note, the show was so long and covered various topics unrelated to NFTs. Here is a summary of that Twitter Spaces with respect to NFT and crypto.</p>



<h2>NFT Marketing is like MLM Schemes</h2>



<ul type="rich"><li><strong>Bombay</strong> highlights how he used NFT communities to build his network. Now he can help projects with NFT marketing.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Noah Patterson</strong> mentions that Azuki spent $400,000 to build and market its NFT project. The key to successful NFT marketing is getting people to buy your project via psychology.</li><li><strong>SoldierSilent</strong> says that MLM schemes have seven principles of influence. The important element is that one person influences another. It&#8217;s all about social proof where people are selling Tupperware from house to house. <strong>SoldierSilent</strong> says he would pitch to a person, and then use that person to get introductions to the rest of their network<strong>. </strong>Using MLM strategy is all about creating an obligation to buy from a person you know. </li><li><strong>Noah Patterson</strong> compares MLMs to crypto: if you buy-in at the top (e.g., first), then you can sell to the rest and capture the most value. Most projects are cookie cutter, and it all comes down to the NFT marketing. Like MLM, crypto is all about having getting your friends to see the project.</li><li><strong>CryptoBella</strong> says she watched friends spin up NFT marketing companies in the last year. <strong>Noah Patterson</strong> chides that anyone who&#8217;s been in the NFT space for more than six months is a guru NFT marketer <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<h2>Blockbuster Making Moves into NFTs</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Noah Patterson</strong> mentions that web3 is a new space that people want to become relevant in. In fact, <a href="https://retailtechinnovationhub.com/home/2022/7/25/blockbuster-back-from-the-grave-linked-with-nfts-move">there&#8217;s rumors that Blockbuster</a> is getting into the NFT space. Their advantage: people will trust the Blockbuster brand regardless of what they release.</li><li><strong>Jak</strong> believes Blockbuster will have an unlimited budget, and as a web3 project, they&#8217;ll be seeking an NFT influencer. <strong>Noah Patterson</strong> says he&#8217;d recommend someone from the gaming community (esp. fighting games) because of how many followers they have. Again, it&#8217;s all about NFT marketing.</li></ul>



<h2>PlayNFT Launches NFT Marketplace For Twitch &amp; YouTube Streamers</h2>



<ul><li><strong>CryptoBella</strong> talks about a new NFT utility platform called <a href="https://egamers.io/playnft-launches-nft-marketplace-for-twitch-youtube-streamers-worldwide/">PlayNFT</a>. It&#8217;s like Twitch or YouTube but gamers can have an NFT attached to their account so that they can sell and market their NFTs.<strong> </strong>Some 260 streamers signed up already. Users also get their own storefront for NFT marketing purposes, allowing them to offer their own branded tokens.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11-1024x576.png" alt="PlayNFT offers strong NFT marketing opportunities by enabling users to offer their own tokens in a storefront." class="wp-image-324" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11-1024x576.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11-300x169.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11-768x432.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<ul><li>Speaking about video streamers, <strong>Noah Patterson</strong> mentions that OnlyFans couldn&#8217;t get VC backing because the content was too explicit. This is an opportunity for crypto. In fact, there&#8217;s one company that offers <a href="https://www.livecoinwatch.com/price/Porn-PORN">Porn Coin</a> that compensates sex workers via an OnlyFans like clone site.</li><li><strong>CryptoBella</strong> likes the notion of a streaming platform that allows creators to control what NFTs they hold and offer.</li><li><strong>Jak</strong> mentions that OpenSea would be better off without NSFW content. At least it&#8217;s not on OpenSea&#8217;s servers because the content is technically hosted on-chain. </li><li>Speaking of NFSW, <strong>MetaRuth_Eth</strong> says she&#8217;s excited for the evolution of technology and its safety features for OnlyFans&#8217; creators. Crypto is building a safer bridge from web2 to web2.5 and eventually to web3 for women. Similarly, new platforms can track how many people come into a metaverse space for sex workers, how long patrons stood in an area, and sell the virtual space as an NFT. <strong>MetaRuth_Eth</strong> says that she sits on the Immersive Emerging Technologies committee for the Indian Women&#8217;s Chamber of Commerce, and she has been showing that organization these features, leading to new perspectives.</li></ul>



<h2>Post-Merge Consequences: Higher APR Yields and Multi-Generation NFTs</h2>



<ul><li><strong>SoldierSilent</strong> says they sat in a presentation from a Coinbase product manager on staking. Prediction: APR yields will increase 50% post merge. As a result, the industry might go from 3% &#8211; 4% APR right now to 4% &#8211; 5% after the merge.</li><li><strong>SoldierSilent</strong> talks about how the difference between POW and POS is that the staking period is undetermined. He&#8217;s getting more ETH for staking compared to now, because POW is limited by capital.</li><li><strong>Dr. Nope</strong> says the ecosystem is where it is, and at the end of the day, the Merge is going to happen. <strong>Noah Patterson</strong> asks if NFTs should take on generation-1 and generation-2 designation for NFT marketing purposes. <strong>Dr. Nope</strong> says that&#8217;s a community choice. <strong>Noah Patterson</strong> talks about how it&#8217;s like when a country reissues currency, and it&#8217;s not recognized. It&#8217;s disruptive to the market.</li><li><strong>Dr. Nope</strong> the Merge will be a slow process. It&#8217;s a mission critical item for the Ethereum Foundation, and they’re running parallel chains to check errors, among other things. The switchover will be much more anti-climatic than people seem to believe.</li><li><strong>Dr. Nope</strong> believes this is an opportunity to in on the ground floor –&nbsp;again. He predicts Ethereum will reach $4k USD per ETH. But if people want it to be a common medium of exchange, crypto needs to achieve price stability. </li></ul>



<h2>More People into Crypto Requires Stability and Lower Risk Perception</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Dr. Nope</strong> says that most people’s risk tolerance is not high, so high risk assets are not attractive. Crypto has to smooth out the volatility to get pension funds involved.</li><li><strong>SoldierSilent</strong> notes that they have been trying to bring some of their friends into NFTs. The challenge is changing the public perception of crypto; until then it&#8217;ll be a high risk asset. The industry needs to self-police and work on its public image in order to bring mass adoption. Positive, non-spammy NFT marketing plays an important role in that capacity.</li><li><strong>Noah Patterson</strong> says people are content to put money in the bank with 1% &#8211; 2% percent returns. If projects can show 5% returns reliably, that&#8217;s going to be huge. But <strong>Dr. Nope</strong> emphasizes slow, sustained growth with minimal price action is the ideal path. Separately, retailers don&#8217;t accept crypto because they’re dealing with vendors who want fiat. It&#8217;s not feasible or realistic to force high risk tolerance down the supply chain.</li></ul>

<h3>Highlights</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Fundraising</strong>. We closed two more investors, adding 20+ years of combined digital media and consumer-app experience to the team. Just $300K left in the round <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f605.png" alt="😅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li><li><strong>Debuted Content Series</strong>. We began experimenting with a content marketing strategy, wherein we <a href="./../../../category/twitter-spaces-summaries/index.html">summarize popular Twitter Spaces</a>. The goal is to generate SEO and shareable social media posts that are amplified by the Spaces&#8217; speakers.</li><li><strong>Overlay Prototype</strong>. Sandeep (Co-founder &amp; CTO) had a genius idea that will help us accelerate the advertising overlay prototype. We now have an internally released extension that can take over ads! It&#8217;s super cool to see it in action <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f60e.png" alt="😎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<h3>Challenges</h3>



<ul><li>None <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f973.png" alt="🥳" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<h3>Asks</h3>



<ul><li>Shoot me a note if you&#8217;re interested in testing the ad overlay prototype!</li></ul>



<p>As usual, we&#8217;re grateful for your ongoing support <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png" alt="🙏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h2>NFT Morning Show: 8Aliens, The Merge, and Market Trends</h2>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/piovincenzo_">Pio.eth</a> hosted the NFT Morning Radio on Aug. 15, 2022, with a runtime of 1:33:39 and 6.3K people tuning in.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/PA2sIeHwUT">https://t.co/PA2sIeHwUT</a></p>&mdash; Pio.eth (@piovincenzo_) <a href="https://twitter.com/piovincenzo_/status/1559525419090690048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Here is a summary of that Twitter Spaces.</p>



<h2>Are you buying 8Aliens?</h2>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/allnick">NFTNick.eth</a></strong> notes that he exited his positions. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> asks if he&#8217;s looking at buying anything on the NFT side. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> says no. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> talks about <strong>8Aliens</strong>, and jokes whether it can take over Bored Apes <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f606.png" alt="😆" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1024x614.png" alt="8Aliens are collectible, interactive NFTs you can chat with." class="wp-image-199" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1024x614.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-300x180.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-768x461.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1536x922.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-2048x1229.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1200x720.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1980x1188.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Each Alien and its associated interactions are generated by algorithms and our Artificial Intelligence.</figcaption></figure>



<ul><li><strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> says he&#8217;s looking for a discount on the top end of the NFT market. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> mentions that 8aliens was a project that caused Nick to raise his eyebrow on the YouTube show. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> deflects critiques that it was outrageous for his show to suggest that 8aliens (an NFT project with 10,000 supply) would go down in price.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>8Aliens has been created by Heptalabs a team of 7 artists and engineers working on turning NFTs into interactive experiences</p><cite>8Aliens OpenSea Description</cite></blockquote></figure>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/SpeculatorArt">Kix.eth</a></strong> says he trashed allow-lists during the bull market, but he likes how 8aliens ensured a good portion of the NFTs were going to people that were bullish or invested in the project. A lot of the free mints get bought by multi wallets and sell at whatever price they want. <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/jesseshalfon">Jesse Halfon</a></strong> talks about how the people that made money were in their discord. </li><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> notes that the most bullish thing for an NFT project is taking legit venture capital money. He mentions how the first bull run in the NFT space would be a fine art bull run and full adoption by the traditional art world.</li></ul>



<h2>NFT Market Trends Report</h2>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/_thesignal">Signal (she/her)</a></strong> notes that overnight trading volume is 14.6 million, down from 25 million. She is seeing a pullback across the market, with BAYC at 79, MAYC at 13.7, and CryptoPunks at 69. <strong>Signal </strong>says the overall crypto is doing well, but the OpenSea volume is down in the mid teens.</li><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> mentions that <a href="https://axie.substack.com/">Axie Infinity</a> has removed token rewards from its classic game mode to attract users to a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/axie-infinity-cuts-rewards-from-classic-game-subtly-forcing-p2e-players-to-new-mode">new game mode</a>. </li><li><strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> notes that authorities arrested a developer who wrote code for Tornado Cash.</li></ul>



<h2>How will the Merge impact NFTs?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Kix.eth</strong> considers a theory suggesting that ETH tops out at $2,200 USD per ETH. <strong>Kix.eth</strong> says the market may be seeing money out in the blue chip NFT projects based on his gut feeling.</li><li><strong>Node</strong> says he put in a couple of offers on different Clone X NFTs.</li><li><strong>Jesse Halfon</strong> offers technical non-analysis, saying ETH is going back to $1200 USD for a couple of months.<strong> </strong>But 2022 is the year of ETH –&nbsp;The Merge is coming. ETH is under-appreciated relative to the technicals, 2021 was the &#8220;Year of NFTs,&#8221; and &#8220;Bitcoin is for Boomers.&#8221; Narrative matters. </li><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> says there&#8217;s a case to be made for sure, and there&#8217;s a lot of uncertainty around The Merge and its impact on price. </li><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/xBenJamminx">BenJammin.eth</a></strong> notes that they’re seeing an NFT bleed after people get excited for prices rising. With the Merge scheduled a month from now, people want to stack ETH because they believe the price will climb due to the Merge. We&#8217;ll likely see more NFT bleeding until then.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-left"><blockquote><p>focus on artists or creators that are trying to grow, rather than aping into NFT degen mints that are likely going to zero.</p><cite><strong>BenJammin.eth</strong></cite></blockquote></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> says it’s hard to identify which artists are favored by the market, but if you strike gold with that, you’ll get rewarded. </li><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/sgsand1">Spencer Gordon-Sand</a></strong> (&#8220;Spencer&#8221;) notes that they’ve been thinking about what happens post-Merge, and he feels giga-bearish on the NFT markets after the Merge. <strong>Spencer</strong> is surprised how well NFT markets have held up, and believes the markets have not seen true capitulation yet. He&#8217;s looking to enter positions on dumps and pick up large positions in a lot of blue chip NFTs.</li><li><strong>Kix.eth</strong> jokes that he&#8217;s going to create a narrative around the proof of work NFTs. Then he&#8217;s going to accumulate a bunch of CryptoPunks, Art Blocks, Bored Apes, and make millions.</li></ul>



<h2>Which NFTs are worth buying? Which NFTs are scams?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> talks about how there&#8217;s interest in Clone X succeeding because it was acquired for a lot of money by Nike. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> says he&#8217;s not bullish on [most?] NFT projects because they&#8217;ve taken money and not doing anything. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> notes that he could make a case that Moonbirds is a web3 business so long as Kevin Rose stays interested.</li><li><strong><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/depechenode_">Node</a></strong>&#8216;s Twitter Poll shows that 60% of people who voted said that it was the most likely &#8220;Top Tier&#8221; project to fade into obscurity.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="600" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-9.png" alt="Azuki starts with a collection of 10,000 avatars that give you membership access to The Garden: a corner of the internet where artists, builders, and web3 enthusiasts meet to create a decentralized future." class="wp-image-220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-9.png 600w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-9-300x300.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-9-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption>The Azuki NFT project is considered a top tier collection, but some question its long-term viability.</figcaption></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> says they&#8217;ve seen loyal communities to projects that were scams. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> mentions that 90% of communities have been loyal to scams. <strong>Node</strong> talks about how there&#8217;s loyalty for projects that never crack one ETH. <strong>Pio.eth</strong> inquires if Azuki raised venture money. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> notes that there&#8217;s plenty of people that took money out, and there&#8217;s stories of misuse of capital. <strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> talks about how there&#8217;s a bunch of people who took advantage of the market and operated without integrity.</li></ul>



<h2>What signal do VCs convey when they invest in an NFT collection?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Node</strong> says the market is where it was in 2021. <strong>Spencer</strong> says he has mixed feelings on whether VC investment mean it&#8217;s a rug or not.<strong> </strong>He&#8217;s seen VC funded projects that tend to sell more new collections.Their incentive is to hit revenue and get acquired.</li><li><strong>NFTNick.eth</strong> talks about how VCs have been dumping on retail consumers via tokens, so integrity is a spectrum. <strong>Kix.eth</strong> says they agree with <strong>Pio.eth</strong>: if VCs invest in an NFT company, it means you can take the rug risk off the table because they&#8217;re betting on their own. <strong>Kix.eth</strong> mentions that Nike is making sure this is a legit operating team.</li><li><strong>Pio.eth</strong> notes that they are sick of NFT projects taking 80% of the primary sale funds and not hiring people. <strong>BenJammin.eth</strong> mentions that it’s a level of patience since hiring 40 to 50 people would take a while.</li></ul>

<h2>NFT Daily Summary, The Merge, and Chimpers NFT</h2>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/farokh/status/1558098734981988355">@Farokh</a> hosted RUG RADIO <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f399.png" alt="🎙" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />: GM NFTs <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2600.png" alt="☀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> on Aug. 12, 2022, with a runtime of 1:34:22 and 2.9K people tuning in.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Here is a summary of that Twitter Spaces.</p>



<h2>Intro &amp; NFT Daily Summary</h2>



<ul><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;wonders where his co-hosts are, roasting <strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong> for a few minutes because he was late <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </li><li>The <a href="https://linktr.ee/rugradio">Rug Radio</a> show starts with a macro and NFT daily summary.  <strong>@Farokh</strong> notes that Ethereum is looking strong and the NFT market is heating up; it&#8217;s fun.&nbsp;He adds that Chimpers NFT team will join them on stage. </li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;jokes that he canceled Pio.eth&#8217;s show earlier that morning.&nbsp;<strong>Pio.eth (@piovincenzo_)</strong>&nbsp;said the Twitter Spaces audio wasn’t working and had to move the show to Discord audio, but it was not good –&nbsp;with about 50% audience drop-off.</li><li><strong>OSF (@osf_nft)</strong>&nbsp;gives the daily market report. He mentions that:<ul><li>there was a sell off in tech stocks</li></ul><ul><li>Bitcoin was flirting with 25k yesterday, and ETH is out performing everything.</li><li>the ETH Merge is being planned for the 15th or 16 September.</li><li>mentions that the proof of work involves a series of algorithms that validate transactions on their own rig, and miners get paid for performing those calculations</li><li>some miners may create a copy of the current network and continue running it as a proof of work methodology, which will duplicate all of the existing ERC tokens, NFTs, etc</li></ul></li></ul>



<h2>What does the ETH Merge mean for your NFTs?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;notes that people have been buying Ethereum classic since the Merge became more on the horizon.</li><li><strong><strong>OSF (@osf_nft)</strong></strong>&nbsp;if miners fork Ethereum now, it will have all the transactions as of the fork&#8217;s date. He adds: <ul><li>Beware of replay attack, where you can replicate a transaction on proof of work from proof of work to proof of stake.&nbsp;</li><li>There&#8217;s a risk you end up selling your Ape on the <em>real</em> ETH proof of stake network at five Eth if you did that transaction on the forked proof of work chain.</li><li>Potential solution: transfer your NFTs on proof of work to a new wallet, and then sell it to minimize the risk of a replay attack.</li><li>Forked POW NFTs should be worth zero, but there may be a market for them. People love meme stuff.</li></ul></li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>Simon (@Simon_Goldberg)</strong>&nbsp;notes that marketplaces (like OpenSea) have to support proof of work to buy or sell NFTs.</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;notes that there&#8217;s always going to be proof work miners on the chain.</li><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;notes that old chains might have some value.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>KΞNOBI (@KenobiDesigns)</strong> inquires if they will have to change terms of service to assign the right IP rights to things.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Simon (@Simon_Goldberg)</strong>&nbsp;mentions that the contract owner will still have access to that contract on proof of work. Project creators have access to the metadata, and if they change one contract, they&#8217;d be able to remove all the data for that chain.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;says they need a long form conversation about the Merge.</li></ul>



<h2>NFT Market Trends</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;mentions that the last three days have been 20 to 25 million volume, which sounds low but is up 60% from the lows of the last month. The top end of the market seems to be holding out, and the majority of the volumes are in newer projects.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;notes that there’s not much going on aside from stuff minting. <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/clonex">Clone X</a> broke under 8 ETH, down 6%, and <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/goblintownwtf">Goblintown</a> is up 20%, but they were strong over 5 to 7 ETH for a long time.</li></ul>

</figure>



<ul><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;says the vast majority of stuff is down over the last seven days, and every single mid tier projects is down 5 to 10%.&nbsp;Bored Apes are flat and CryptoPunks are relatively flat, but the top tier stuff is still holding. Some mid-tier projects are up: Penguins are up 50%. CryptoDickButts are up 60%. </li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;notes that there&#8217;s been a lot of fun stuff you could get in on, and new projects are cracking up.&nbsp;<strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;notes that they&#8217;ve had multiple sweeps over the last couple of weeks, and they don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re going back into USDC because of the pump or just holding on to the ETH.</li><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;says if volume returns to a seasoned project, it’s getting sold into.&nbsp;He notes that there’s only very few projects out there, and when they see a pump, a lot of people will use this opportunity to sell. Mando says that the overall markets in OpenSea volumes are at 200 million in volume, which would show a bottoming of the NFT market.&nbsp;If OS does the same volume as July, that would be a good sign.</li></ul>



<h2>Building NFT Brands in the Bear Market</h2>



<ul><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;talks about how every pump brings on more listings, and every time your project goes up in value, there’s going to be a lot of people that are going to rush the list.&nbsp;He mentions that it’s going to be more work on the founder side this time around.&nbsp;Farokh&nbsp;notes that being a genuine founder in NFT isn’t easy at the moment, spending 100 plus hours a week trying to create value for holders, and any impact of work gets immediately sold.</li><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;notes that often the projects which are showing value are the ones which continue to deliver.&nbsp;He&nbsp;mentions that it makes sense that people want to secure their finances more during this period.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;mentions that the market is so small, it&#8217;s complicated to the average person, and they need to go to the toilet three times.&nbsp;Farokh&nbsp;notes that if the month of August is just a month of uncertainty, it&#8217;s just a month of people really need liquidity.</li><li><strong>Mando (@greatmando_nft)</strong>&nbsp;notes that they&#8217;ve been given more opportunities to invest in startups in the space.&nbsp;It&#8217;s difficult to assess value and business plans.&nbsp;Mando says they often don&#8217;t know if a project isn&#8217;t doing well, and if they have the right founders, they can reenergize.&nbsp;The concept of 99% of projects going to zero means that 99% of founders are going to fail. Failure is going to have to be accepted. They would love to see a project which doesn’t feel like it’s hitting the right tone when it comes to the utility. They’d rather the whole community migrate to a new utility.</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;notes that a lot of people forget that building the community is one part and nurturing that community is the second part.&nbsp;It&#8217;s about being around and showing up.</li><li><strong>OSF (@osf_nft)</strong>&nbsp;says a lot of it comes down to how much money you took in upfront and what you stated you would do with that money. There are other ways you can drive value back to that project. <strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;says that someone in their Discord built a model evaluation showing Rug Radio was valued at $60 million.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>OSF (@osf_nft)</strong>&nbsp;talks about how it took them a year to bring their project back to a level they were at.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;notes that if you raise money last year and you&#8217;re giving up now, then you never had it.</li><li><strong>Ser Joey (@PunkHot10)</strong>&nbsp;says they understand that the duty to carry on and try is to increase revenue and profit, but people fail a lot within that.</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;notes how Ser Joey used to run a weekly chart where trending punks were voted on.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>Chimpers NFT: Background &amp; What&#8217;s Next</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Timpers.eth <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f47e.png" alt="👾" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@TimpersHD)</strong>&nbsp;talks about joining the NFT space in February 2021.&nbsp;He says they started graphic design shop when he was 15 years old. He did a lot of Youtube videos, tutorials, and tips. Later, he went to university to study animation and got a degree in that. Timpers says he was lucky to work with BAYC in an art piece and that it went well.</li><li><strong>@Farokh</strong>&nbsp;inquires about how they got involved in Chimper NFT adventures.</li></ul>

<p>Welcome to <a href="http://alphaback.xyz/">AlphaBack&#8217;s</a> Twitter Spaces Summaries (#TSS). In this series, we summarize Twitter Spaces that you don&#8217;t want to miss. Why? Because we all love Twitter Spaces, but dammit if they aren&#8217;t difficult to tune into at times – whether it&#8217;s the inconvenient timing or unedited / off-topic meandering. In this first post of the series, the Koala Bot Club talks about its game automation platform and its integration with the #SolSuite platform.</p>



<p><em>n.b. Summaries are edited for brevity and inconsistencies may occur due to crosstalk or audio quality. The content presented is not financial advice. Do your own research and review <a href="#disclaimerandrisks">the disclaimer below</a>.</em></p>
